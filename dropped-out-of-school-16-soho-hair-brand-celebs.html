A private members club side of the business founded by its members/ clients who simply loved hanging out in our space.</p><p>"I would love to see the 64 brand take over this industry with the same success it’s had in the hair industry."</p><p>Making his business stand out from the rest was key.</p><p>In his twenties and bursting with new ideas, Ricky decided to focus on his youth and unique value, exceptional customer service, innovative products and effective branding, as well as cultivating a strong online presence.</p><p>He said: "Salons had been the same for years! If you stopped 100 people on the street and asked them to draw a hair salon they would all scribble the same image. Mirror, chair, mirror, chair … boring!<br>It was time to spice things up.</p><p>"We listened to what clients were craving and answered these questions.</p><p>"A full cocktail bar located within the salon for the ultimate pre drinks, seats all facing around a fire pit, a space that can change from looking like a salon to looking like a private members club in the blink of an eye.</p><p>"It was seen as the new kid on the block, but SALON64 was also becoming famous for doing things completely differently."</p><p>Working with people across the fashion, stage and screen worlds, Ricky quickly understood that there was potential to grow his brand - as the spotlight is always shining on the celebrity's hair.</p><p>He said: "When you style the hair for the same famous faces over and over they not only become your friends but you also become hugely invested in their careers and successes.</p><p>"Weather an actress winning a BAFTA or a stand up comedian hosting the awards their hairdresser is never usually far away, behind the camera and lurking off the set, always full of pride.</p><p>"They have seen their client grow and been lucky enough to grow alongside them.</p><p>"And as our range expanded I found our clients have done most of the advertising for us by recommending products to friends and family and showing them off in their bathrooms.</p><p>"Our trademark “Mirror glass ripple effect” is seen on heads of hair across our social page and when asked how we achieve such results we simply point to our shampoo and conditioner, as this is how incredible hair is born."</p><p>We can't leave without asking Ricky his favourite hairstyles of the moment.</p><p>He said: "The Shag, The Wolf Cut, The Modern Mullet. Call it whatever you like I am loving collar bone length hair with tons of layers, diffused to bring out natural movement and curl I think its gives the hair plenty of eye catching attitude."</p><p>And his favourite day in the salon? Ricky told us: "I am fortunate enough to have plenty of really memorable days.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"Whether shooting for Vogue or on set of a favourite tv show.</p><p>"However I still find walking around a packed SALON64 specially round Christmas time with every single chair in the building taken on both floors does still fill me with a sense of accomplishment. Seeing our clients enjoying the space exactly as it was intended."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2023-05-03-22.24.47.webp> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2022-05-19-at-22.59.20-1.webp> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/247f1e6f-60e4-4da1-ae91-a25600020c90.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4502.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/51e2b617-89ba-4f3f-b6ea-97b4f74bb231.jpeg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhqZWeBd4WRb2adqp%2BlvaawjKisrWWfm3q0r8eopqVlYWt6tLvHqGShmZmneqO%2BwKebZpuVobKjv44%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdropped-out-of-school-16-soho-hair-brand-celebs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdropped-out-of-school-16-soho-hair-brand-celebs.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdropped-out-of-school-16-soho-hair-brand-celebs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdropped-out-of-school-16-soho-hair-brand-celebs.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdropped-out-of-school-16-soho-hair-brand-celebs.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdropped-out-of-school-16-soho-hair-brand-celebs.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./milania-giudice-opens-up-i-miss-my-dad-so-much.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./milania-giudice-opens-up-i-miss-my-dad-so-much.html>I Miss My Dad SO Much!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./darcey-silva-flaunts-sizzling-bikini-body-after-weight-loss-surgery.html>Darcey Silva Flaunts Sizzling Bikini Body After Weight Loss Surgery</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./darcey-silva-flaunts-sizzling-bikini-body-after-weight-loss-surgery.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
