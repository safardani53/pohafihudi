Then she became a member of the royal family.</p><p>So, our Karen has also become an aunt to the Kardashian family’s kids.</p><p>But believe us when we say that if someone is related to that family then they will become a popular celebrity</p><p>Regardless of their relationship with the family, all media attention will be focused on them.&nbsp;While Karen is in the spotlight too.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Karen_Houghton_Early_Childhood_Days></span>Karen Houghton Early Childhood Days<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Karen Houghton was <strong>born on November 24, 1958, in the United States of America.</strong> Her <strong>parents are Mary Jo and Robert True Houghton.</strong></p><p>Her mother owned a children’s clothing store, and her father was an engineer. But her parents’ marriage did not last for many years.</p><p>After a few years of marriage, the couple separated, and then Karen’s mother, Mary Jo, married a businessman named Harry Shannon.</p><p>Mary Shannon took custody of the children. So, Karen and her sister Kris stayed with their stepfather, Harry Shannon.</p><p>And Mary and Harry had a son named Steve.</p><p>But after a few years, Karen’s stepfather’s company faced severe bankruptcy, so they left California city and shifted to San Diego.</p><p>However, there is no official information about Karen’s educational background. We will try to update the section after we have received accurate information.</p><p>But Karen Houghton is a part-time nurse, so she might have taken some science courses in her high school years.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Karen_Houghton_Age></span>Karen Houghton Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Karen Houghton is 65 years old as of 2023</strong> as she was born on 24 November 1958.</p><p>Despite her age, Karen continues to excel in her dual roles as a part-time nurse and author.</p><p>Her experience and wisdom gained over the years have made her a valuable asset in the healthcare field, where she provides compassionate care to her patients.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Karen_Houghton_Siblings_Relationship></span>Karen Houghton Siblings Relationship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.nextbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Karen-houghton-1.jpg><p><strong>Karen Houghton has always been referred to as the elder sister of the Houghton family because Kris looks so young.</strong></p><p>But the truth is, Karen is the younger sister.</p><p>Mostly, Karen and Kris always hit the newspaper headlines due to their roller-coaster behavioral activities.</p><p>In one interview, Kris added that she loves her sister very much and shares a beautiful bond like no other sisters. And even Karen acknowledged that.</p><p>But a few years ago, Karen Houghton was hospitalized for medical reasons.</p><p>But Kris didn’t make her visit to Karen. No one, however, can do this to their adored sister. Will everyone’s heart race if they see their sister in that condition? But it wasn’t for Kris.</p><p>That incident affected Karen: she publicly stated that Kris had changed and that her money and fame had made her forget her own family and become rude. Etc.</p><p>We want to emphasize the fault on the Karen side too. Sisters are born to fight and pull their hair out. But it doesn’t mean they will defame their sister in public. Family matters above everything.</p><p>Following the wrongdoings of both sisters, the relationship became strained.</p><p>Karen and Kris would then realize their errors and reunited in 2019.</p><p>Even now, they have frequently been visiting each other, and we can see that in the posts of Karen’s daughter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Karen_Houghton_Career></span>Karen Houghton Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Karen Houghton is a part-time nurse. And she has been a part of people’s lives for many years.</strong></p><p>But she is also a great cook, so Karen has released two books to help others with their cooking.&nbsp;Karen released volume one of Naturally Gourmet Cookbook in 2010 and volume two in 2013.</p><p>However, writing a book is not an easy task. We must have some implicit knowledge to share with others.</p><p>Thus, it shows that Karen is a more knowledgeable person. Why? Isn’t cooking an art?</p><p>The person who cooks well can directly reach the other person’s heart. And that is such a divine and respectable job.</p><p>Karen Houghton has done it exceptionally well. And now she has been releasing her books.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Karen_Houghton_Net_Worth></span>Karen Houghton Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Karen Houghton’s <strong>net worth is estimated to be around $2 million</strong>, which she may have earned through her career and book publishing.</p><p>In addition to that, Kris has also supported her financially. For example, Kris has presented her younger sister with a brand-new Mercedes car.&nbsp;Kris assisted in the $50,000 interior redesign of Karen’s home in 2009.</p><p>That’s how the family operates. We fight and fight, but we care for them to the utmost; thus, the sister duo was never exceptional in that aspect.</p><p>We can see Kris’s love for her sister Karen, and Karen reciprocates the love with her emotional support.</p><p>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>Who is Sofia Carson’s Sister Paulina Char?

But she got married in 1996 to Mark Zettel.</strong> Then Natalie, the couple’s adorable daughter, was born.</p><p>But the couple got separated in 2006 because her former husband was a drug addict and got arrested for his drug activities.</p><p>In addition to that, Mark was abusing Karen mentally and physically even as he became a threat to Natalie, her daughter.</p><p>Karen seeks the help of the police to protect her daughter and herself from her husband, Mark.</p><p>Then, after some years, Karen Houghton dated Steven Edward Thornton. But the irony is that even he is a criminal. He was arrested for many burglary and theft cases.</p><p>Karen’s personal life seemed to be more devastating and saddening. We hope she may look for some good guys shortly.</p><p>On the other hand, Kris has decided to drift away from Karen due to her personal life scandal. Why? Well, Karen has to protect the image of the Kardashian family.</p><p>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>Who is Huma Abedin’s Sister Heba Abedin?</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Karen_Houghton_Physical_Appearance></span>Karen Houghton Physical Appearance<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>We were unable to obtain accurate body measurements for Karen Houghton. But in 2016, Karen had face-lift surgery to look like her sister Kris.</p><p>And surprisingly, she succeeded and now appears to be 15 years younger from her age. All credit goes to the plastic surgeon, Dr. Ben Talei.</p><p>Kris and Karen looked alike in their earlier days, but after getting married and having children, Karen lost her glow.</p><p>But she was tired of enhancing her physical beauty.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Karen_Houghton_Facts></span>Karen Houghton Facts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><li>Karen Houghton is the younger sister of Kris Jenner, a famous media personality and businesswoman in the USA.</li><li>She gained fame due to her sister’s celebrity and the controversies surrounding their family.</li><li>Karen is also an aunt to the Kardashian family’s children.</li><li>Her parents’ marriage didn’t last, and she and Kris were raised by their stepfather, Harry Shannon.</li><li>Karen’s educational background is not officially known, but she is a part-time nurse.</li><li>As of 2023, Karen is 65 years old and continues to work as a nurse and author.</li><li>She has had a rocky relationship with Kris but has recently reconciled.</li><li>Karen is known for her cooking skills and has authored two cookbooks.</li><li>Her estimated net worth is around $2 million, and she has received financial support from Kris in the past.</li><p>Well, we have arrived at the conclusion.
