The successful star has been the winner of many prestigious awards, including an Academy Award in 1998, and he’s up for a 2024 Golden Globe Award in the Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy category for his role in Air.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>However, when the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hollywood heartthrob</a> is not busy working on the set of movies, he is often spotted with his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wife and kids</a>. Below is everything to know about <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Matt’s wife</a>, their love story, and their family!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/matt-damon-wife-ss-embed.jpg><h2>Who Is Matt Damon’s Wife?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/matt-damon-wife-ss-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>The Cambridge, Massachusetts born A-lister has been married to&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Luciana “Lucy” Barroso</strong></a>, 47, for nearly 20 years! The brunette beauty and Matt <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>got married in 2005</a> just two years after they first met. Since then, their love story has continued to blossom and he remains sprung over the Argentine native.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>During a July 2013 interview with Esquire (via <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Daily News</a>), Matt revealed that he was happy that he fell in love with a regular person. “I got lucky. I fell in love with a civilian,” he told the outlet of his marriage to Lucy. “Not an actress and not a famous actress at that. Because then the attention doesn’t double-it grows exponentially.”</p><h2>How Did Matt Damon Meet His Wife?</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-6><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Matt and Lucy</a> first met in 2003 while he was filming the movie,&nbsp;Stuck on You, alongside&nbsp;<strong>Greg Kinnear</strong>. During a 2011 interview on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a>&nbsp;Matt told <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ellen DeGeneres&nbsp;</strong></a>the story of how he serendipitously met Lucy.&nbsp;The Worth of Water&nbsp;author went out to a bar with some of his co-stars and met his wife at the bar that she worked at during that time. “I literally saw her across a crowded room, literally,” he explained at the time. “Eight years and four kids later, that’s my life. I don’t know how else our paths would’ve crossed if that didn’t happen. If all those things didn’t happen.”</p><h2>What Matt Damon Has Said About His Wife</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Since their 2005 nuptials, Matt has gushed over Lucy countless times. The proud husband even has his leading lady’s name <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tattooed</a> on his arm (see <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo here</a>)! Most recently, on Jul. 17, he told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a>&nbsp;a private detail about a therapy session that he and his spouse had. “I had — not to get too personal — negotiated extensively with my wife that I was taking time off,” he explained while promoting <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Oppenheimer</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“I had been in&nbsp;Interstellar, and then&nbsp;<strong>Chris [Nolan]</strong> put me on ice for a couple of movies, so I wasn’t in the rotation, but I actually <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>negotiated in couples therapy</a> — this is a true story — the one caveat to my taking time off was if Chris Nolan called,” he went to add during <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the interview</a>. “This is without knowing whether or not he was working on anything, because he never tells you. He just calls you out of the blue. And so, it was a moment in my household.”</p><h2>Matt Damon & Luciana Barroso’s Kids</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/matt-damon-wife-ss-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Of course, Lucy and Matt’s love story got only cuter after the pair welcomed their first daughter, <strong>Isabella</strong>, in 2006. Later, they went on to welcome <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two more daughters</a> including <strong>Gia </strong>(b. 2008) and <strong>Stella</strong> (b. 2010). Matt is also a proud stepdad to Lucy’s daughter, <strong>Alexia Barroso</strong>, whom she welcomed with her previous husband, <strong>Arbello Barroso</strong>. During a 2012 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TODAY</a>, the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>father-of-four</a> shared his experience of always being surrounded by girls.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“I never expected to be surrounded by girls,&nbsp; but it’s great. …You never know which way life’s going to take you,” he said at the time. “I’m learning so much, not the least of which is how much smarter girls are. I operated under the assumption that us guys had a chance, but I realized when I was completely wrapped around my 2-year-old’s finger, and she knew it. If they can do that to us at 2 years old, when they’re fully grown we really don’t stand a chance.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8yaq61llJa6sLqMsKCfnV1qfnV8lW1uaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmatt-damon-wife-5140647.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmatt-damon-wife-5140647.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmatt-damon-wife-5140647.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmatt-damon-wife-5140647.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmatt-damon-wife-5140647.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmatt-damon-wife-5140647.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./liz-torres.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./liz-torres.html>Liz Torres</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./akin-akinozu.html>Akin Akinozu Age, Height, Wife, Girlfriend, Birthday, Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./akin-akinozu.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
