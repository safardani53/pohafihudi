In June 2023, Hunter was charged on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>federal misdemeanor charges</a> of failing to pay federal income tax and a felony charge of illegally possessing a weapon. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>He pleaded not guilty to federal misdemeanor charges</a> of ​​failing to pay federal income tax the following month.

She also minored in art history.

"She dominated. She was great, you know, and we went undefeated. The Vipers ruled."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While some of the parents on the opposing team took issue with a president leading a kid's basketball team, Maisy said the team owed their success to their skill rather than their coach. "There's a lot of teams that were like, 'This is unfair, they can't have the president be their coach,' but I mean, we won," Maisy said on the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>TODAY</a> show in January 2021.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Maisy followed in both her older sisters’ footsteps and attended the University of Pennsylvania, which she graduated from in 2023.

A paternity test ultimately proved him to be the father.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2023, it was revealed that Hunter and Roberts' child was a daughter named Navy Joan Roberts. Soon after, Republicans began criticizing President Joe Biden for previously touting his "six grandchildren," claiming he wasn't acknowledging Navy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a July 2023 statement provided exclusively to PEOPLE, President Biden pushed back at the criticism, saying, “Our son Hunter and Navy’s mother, Lunden, are working together to foster a relationship that is in the best interests of their daughter, preserving her privacy as much as possible going forward. This is not a political issue, it’s a family matter. Jill and I only want what is best for all of our grandchildren, including Navy.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A source familiar with the situation told PEOPLE that the recently resolved child support dispute between Hunter and Roberts has dictated how the relationship has played out so far.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You have to remember there were some fairly contentious legal proceedings between Navy’s parents happening until just a few weeks ago.
