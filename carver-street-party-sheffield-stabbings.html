If I go out I make sure to be back for 10pm so I don’t have to see it.</p><p>“I’m not surprised we’ve had another stabbing. But what I am surprised at is the council granting more and more licences - bringing fights and knives along with it.</p><p>“They need to put a stop to handing out licences to pubs and clubs here. It needs to be spread across Sheffield rather than all concentrated in one area that is notorious for fights, and now and again a murder.”</p><p>Young mum Mina Habibi, 24, who lives in her flat with her one-year-old son Elija, says she too feels trapped inside her own home, and even gets her shopping delivered to avoid having to step outside.</p><p>“I don’t feel safe, especially with my baby,” she says.&nbsp;</p><p>“There are enough bars around here that you have drunk people around during the day.&nbsp;</p><p>“One time a guy was so drunk he fell over the pram.

He probably didn’t even know he'd done it.</p><p>“That has scared me and I try to go out as little as possible.”</p><p>Mark Ryan, 65, who owns Ryan Vintage directly opposite Carver Street, says local businesses suffer as a result of the escalating crime.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/carver-street-sheffield-nicknamed-party-846535092.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/230920-Party-street-Sheffield-Carver-Street.00_01_15_02.Still024.jpg><p>“Whenever there is violence, the police come and cordon off the street for a couple of days and people can’t get to the store,” he says.</p><p>“I’m one of the only retailers left here, it’s all taken up with bars and clubs, <a href=#>vape</a> shops and off licences.”</p><p>He too believes the council is granting liquor licences too easily.&nbsp;</p><p>“This is the nightclub spot in Sheffield and the number of nightclubs and bars is increasing,” Mark explains.</p><p>“Drinkers will do a pub crawl on West Lane and end here on Carver Street for the clubs, and they’re very drunk by the time they get here.</p><p>I don’t feel safe, especially with my baby...

We don’t get enough value for the rates we are paying, there are not enough police and the streets aren’t cleaned enough. After a weekend here it can really smell of pee and vomit, it’s filthy.</p><p>“Instead it wastes money on schemes like a bear exhibition or <a href=#>ULEZ</a> charges.”</p><p>But students Kate Maxim and Reece Moss, both 19, say they love the cheap booze on offer on Carver Street and don’t feel scared on nights out.</p><p>“I don’t see a lot of trouble here. I’m from <a href=#>Manchester</a> - it’s worse there,” says Kate.</p><p>“It’s great that everything is close together - it means you don’t have far to travel and can stay in the one area.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/carver-street-sheffield-nicknamed-party-846535061.jpg><p>“It’s a very student-orientated city so there are lots of venues with student prices - on Wednesdays drinks are generally around £2 a go.”</p><p>A spokesperson for South Yorkshire Police told The Sun: “We take the safety of our local residents extremely seriously and currently have a number of ongoing initiatives working with local neighbourhood policing teams throughout the city centre.</p><p>“Throughout Freshers Week a number of plain clothed officers completed a series of patrols around Carver Street as part of our ongoing Operation Sentinel activity, a dedicated operation which focuses on observing and intervening violent behaviour towards women and girls.</p><p>“Officers are specifically looking to safeguard the vulnerable from sexual violence and violent crime through proactive disruptive patrols as well as identifying predatory behaviour by potential perpetrators and prevent further offences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“In addition, we have extra uniformed officers deployed to Carver Street throughout this weekend (September 22-23) to act as a visible deterrent for those seeking to commit crime, providing support and reassurance for those wishing to enjoy the vibrant night-time economy Sheffield city centre has to offer.&nbsp;</p><p>“Our officers will also be joined by our police dogs in bids to clamp down on the issue of drugs and drug supply within the city.</p><p>“Officers from our GRIP Programme have recently met with representatives for Carver Street licensed venues to discuss further activity, including installing ID scanners and body worn cameras, coordinating efforts to ensure the safety of venue staff and members of the public.&nbsp;</p><p>“The GRIP team continue to conduct hotspot policing patrols which incorporate Carver Street with the aim of reducing most serious violence in the area.&nbsp;</p><p>“The GRIP Programme is a Home Office funded project that focuses on delivering activity to reduce most serious violence through deterrence-based targeted hotspot policing and SARA model (Scanning, Analysis, Response and Assessment) problem solving.</p><p>“Additional work completed in the area also involves Op Sceptre - an initiative developed to tackle the national concern around knife crime.”</p><p>The Sun has reached out to Sheffield City Council for comment.</p><p>Councillor Joe Otten, chair of the Waste and Street Scene Committee, said: “The safety of people enjoying the night-time economy is hugely important, which is why the council operates a Best Bar None scheme in partnership with Sheffield BID and South Yorkshire Police.</p><p>"For 11 years the Home Office supported accreditation scheme has recognised and encouraged responsible licensing in the city, which includes ensuring that bar, nightclub and other licensable premises operate within the four core licensing objectives.</p><p>"More than 40 venues are signed up the scheme in Sheffield city centre. This helps to keep people safe when they are enjoying a night out in Sheffield.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>A spokesperson for The Guinness Partnership said:&nbsp;“We are sorry to hear that our residents at Cambridge Court are experiencing problems with noise from Carver Street.</p><p>"The homes currently have double glazing, and we haven’t received any complaints about the noise directly.
