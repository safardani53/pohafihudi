I am sorry for everything”.</p><p>A painful divorce from actor Robert Keith was also believed to have played a part in her turmoil.</p><p>It is said her ghost still haunts the area around the sign.</p><p>Big-name stars from the golden age of cinema including Bela Lugosi and Humphrey Bogart were among the initial residents of Hollywoodland.</p><p>In the 1930s they were joined by Bugsy Siegel who was one of the founders of the organised crime syndicate Murder, Inc.</p><p>Siegel, who died in a hail of bullets in 1947, befriended stars of the time including Jean Harlow, who was god-mother to one of his daughters.</p><p>It was not an isolated friendship — there were lots of rumours of links between the film industry and the mob during the 1920s.</p><p>The Hollywood sign was supposed to last for 18 months.</p><p>But it was left in place because the developers could not shift all the lots before going bankrupt in the Great Depression of the 1930s.</p><p>In 1944 the Hollywoodland sign became the property of Los Angeles and the unsold plots were used for locals to walk in.</p><h2>INFRARED CAMERAS AND 24 HOUR SURVEILLANCE</h2><p>Around this time, the H fell down in a storm and the letters still standing were in a poor state.</p><p>Jeff Zarrinnam, the chair of the Hollywood Sign Trust, tells The Sun: “People were complaining that it was becoming an eyesore.”</p><p>It would have been scrapped if The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which now owns it, had not decided to refurbish it.</p><p>At this point, the final four letters — Land — were dispensed with.</p><p>Soon the Hollywood Hills area went upmarket — but crime was never far away.</p><p>The death of resident Elizabeth Short remains one of America’s greatest unsolved murders.</p><p>Nicknamed Black Dahlia after her killing, Elizabeth’s naked body was discovered severed into two pieces in 1947.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/elizabeth-short-aka-black-dahlia-823787199.jpg><p>By 1978 the Hollywood letters were looking worse for wear again.</p><p>A plan was hatched to auction off each of them, at a price of £22,000 per letter.</p><p>The money would be used to replace the sign.</p><p>Rocker <a href=#>Alice Cooper</a> was the first to put his hand in his pocket and he was quickly followed by Hugh Hefner, who held a fundraiser at his Playboy Mansion.</p><p>That rebuilt structure still stands today.</p><p>Mount Lee, the public land on which the letters stand, is difficult to get to and, infamously, has become a place at which to bury murder victims.</p><p>In 2012 the head of former airline worker Hervey Medellin, who had lived in the area, was discovered close to the sign — separated from the rest of his remains.</p><p><a href=#>Brad Pitt</a>’s home was close enough for his bodyguards to be asked if they had seen any strange goings-on in the area.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/brad-pitt-arrives-92nd-oscars-725755206.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2012-several-body-part-scattered-823789067.jpg><p>Four years later, hikers discovered the human skull of a 20-year-old woman not far from the sign.</p><p>It had been buried there for less than a decade. How she came to die is unclear.</p><p>What is certain is that Hollywood continues to lure young hopefuls with its bright lights and promises of fame.</p><p>Tragically, model Kristine Johnson, 21, was a victim of those hopes in 2003 — her remains were also found by hikers.</p><p>Victor Lawrence Paleologus posed as a filmmaker to tell her he could line up a part in a James Bond film.</p><p>Instead, he strangled Kristine to death and buried her in the Hollywood Hills.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2003-strangled-lured-death-man-823788908.jpg><p>It would seem that the sign itself is far better protected than Hollywood’s residents.</p><p>The local chamber of commerce has installed infrared cameras, 24-hour surveillance and huge fences in order to fend off graffiti artists and prevent anyone else falling to their death.</p><p>They have also trademarked the sign’s distinctive font and style.</p><p>There has been talk of installing a gondola to take tourists up to the structure, and of building a visitor centre.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>But Prof Braudy believes anyone wishing to visit this shrine to the American dream should have to struggle their way up the long path.</p><p>He says: “It’s about aspiration, it’s about the difficulty of it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2j0djah-famous-white-hollywood-sign-823828058.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwY2iAeYCTaKCnq5mZsm6%2F06ipsmWYpLmtxdaopp1lo560r3nBq5idZaCewbV5x6iknmWSpLG6ew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-story-hollywood-sign-brad-pitt-home-body.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2finside-story-hollywood-sign-brad-pitt-home-body.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2finside-story-hollywood-sign-brad-pitt-home-body.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2finside-story-hollywood-sign-brad-pitt-home-body.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-story-hollywood-sign-brad-pitt-home-body.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-story-hollywood-sign-brad-pitt-home-body.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./pete-davidson-reunites-with-ex-carly-aquilino-at-comedy-show-pic.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./pete-davidson-reunites-with-ex-carly-aquilino-at-comedy-show-pic.html>Pete Davidson Reunites With Ex Carly Aquilino at Comedy Show: Pic</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./harry-metcalfe.html>Harry Metcalfe Net Worth, Wife, Age, Height, Daughter, Wiki</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./harry-metcalfe.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
