I told last month how the Stones are planning to release their first album of new music in 18 years.</p><p>A source said: “After Charlie Watts’ passing there was some uncertainty about what to do next. But they feel it’s the right thing to keep doing what they’ve always done – make new music and ­perform it to their fans.”</p><p>Whatever Dua and Mick have in store, I reckon it’s going to be massive.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>LEIGH'S HIP-HOP HOOK-UP</h2><p>IT looks like Leigh-Anne Pinnock will be getting into hip-hop with her solo career, as she is working with one of the genre’s biggest producers.</p><p>The Little Mix star has been in the studio with Chauncey Hollis, better known as Hit-Boy The chart-topping producer has spent years working with superstars including <a href=#>Beyonce</a>, <a href=#>Rihanna</a> and <a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/msemail_MM3R6584jpg-JS772719759.jpg><p>Leigh-Anne spent time in LA working on tracks earlier this year and made several songs with the renowned hitmaker, who has worked with many other music heavyweights including <a href=#>Kanye West</a>, <a href=#>Jay-Z</a> and <a href=#>Travis Scott</a>. A source said: “<a href=#>Leigh-Anne</a> has been working out what sort of music feels best for her, and she’s been making great progress.</p><p>“A lot of the songs have a heavy R&B vibe and others have strong hip-hop influences.</p><p>“It’s the music she listens to the most so it makes sense to follow that path.</p><p>“Leigh has great names working with her so she is on to a winner.”<br>It’s been six months since Little Mix went on hiatus so I’m hoping it’s not too much longer before we finally get to hear what Leigh-Anne, <a href=#>Perrie Edwards</a> and <a href=#>Jade Thirwall</a> have been working on in the studio.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>IT'S NOT ALL WORK, WORK, WORK</h2><p>IT’S not all work, work work for Rihanna.</p><p>The We Found Love hit-maker was made to feel like the Only Girl (In The World) as she enjoyed a date night with rapper beau <a href=#>A$AP Rocky</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/BGUK_2519590_065_PREMIUM-EXCLUSIVE-MUST-CALL-FOR-PRICING-Rihanna-and-AAP-Rocky-attend-the-Imagi-JS77-1.jpg><p>RiRi sported a bright red slashed minidress and beaded braids as they attended the Imagine ­Reggae show in <a href=#>Barbados</a> hand in hand.</p><p>It’s been a big year for the couple after they welcomed their first child in May.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rihanna is set for an epic live comeback when she headlines next year’s Super Bowl.
