Is this how it goes?'"</p><p>She added: "I was thinking about some of my lowest moments during that time what was contributing to all of it was I was in horrible health, and I didn’t care about that piece of it, and you don’t realize how bad it gets and then you’re compounding it, your health gets worse, because you’re not well, and it went on and on."</p><p>Hoda talked about how difficult it was to deal with everything going on all at once.</p><p>“You realize when you’re on solid ground again, and you look back, and you’re like, ‘Oh my gosh I didn’t take an hour for myself,’ there were all the things I never ever did that I am doing today that make such a difference,” she concluded.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>HODA ON!</strong></h2><p>All this comes after Hoda went missing from&nbsp;<a href=#>Today</a>&nbsp;on Monday as she spends time with family away from work.</p><p>The broadcast journalist has been enjoying quality time with her&nbsp;<a href=#>two children, Haley Joy, and Hope Catherine.</a></p><p>The TV personality was replaced by familiar face&nbsp;<a href=#>Sheinelle Jones</a>&nbsp;who joined&nbsp;<a href=#>Savannah Guthrie</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Craig Melvin</a>.</p><p>The anchors made no mention of their co-host's absence, though she hinted at the reason behind her disappearance on&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;Sunday.</p><p>Hoda took to the platform to share snaps with her family as they celebrated her sister Hala's birthday.</p><p>In the first photo of the post, the author's entire brood was spread out in a living room, with multiple children lying across the floor and coloring.</p><p>All the little ones created birthday cards for the star's sister Hala, as they gathered together for the special occasion.</p><p>The third picture showed Hoda standing with the birthday girl and other family, as they held up matching shirts with her name on the photo on the front.</p><p>She also added snaps of her kids hugging their grandmother and cousins, as well as simple pics showing off their sweet smiles.</p><p>Hoda filmed the colorful decorations at the party and posed for a large group photo with her entire family.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>She captioned the post: "Early bday surprise for my sis!!!
