Let’s review his career in detail below.</span></p><h3><span>Early Career</span></h3><p><span>Juan used to play competitive basketball in 2007 with the youth teams of CB Las Rozas. It is a basketball team that is based in Las Rozas de Madrid, Spain, which was founded in 1987.</span></p><p><span>He then went on to join a youth squad of Real Madrid. He continued to play on the team until he moved on to Club Baloncesto Majadahonda in 2012.</span></p><h3><span>CB Estudiantes</span></h3><p><span>Juan’s first professional career started with CB Estudiantes. He signed his first professional contract in 2012. He competed with their second team for two years, after which he was promoted to the main team.</span></p><p><span>From 2015 to 2016, he averaged 9.7 points and 5.7 rebounds in 34 games. For that season, he was named the ACB Best Young Player.</span></p><p></p><h3><span>National Team Career</span></h3><p><span>In 2013, Juan played in the Spain national under-18 basketball team at the FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship in Latvia.</span></p><p><span>Moreover, he joined the under-20 team for two consecutive years. He also helped the senior Spain national team practice at the EuroBasket 2015.</span></p><p><span>Later on, he joined the senior Spain national team major tournament at the EuroBasket 2017.</span></p><p><span>There, he averaged 8.4 points, 5.9 rebounds, 0.7 assists, and 0.7 blocked shots in 19.7 minutes per game. At the time, Spain finished in third place and won the bronze medal.</span></p><p><span>Once again, in June 2018, Juan was drafted for Spain National Team in advance of the first stage of qualifiers for the 2019 FIBA World Cup.</span></p><h3><span>Denver Nuggets</span></h3><p><span>Juan was picked in the international early entry candidates list for the 2016 NBA draft on 26 April 2016.</span></p><p><span>He was selected by Denver Nuggets with the 15th overall pickup. On 9 August 2016, he signed his rookie contract with the Denver Nuggets.</span></p><p><span>Under the flexible assignment rule, on 4 January 2017, he was assigned to the Sioux Falls Skyforce of the NBA Development League, an American professional basketball team that plays in the NBA G League.</span></p><p><span>He appeared in one game for the Sioux Falls Skyforce, but he was recalled by the Denver Nuggets three days later.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Juan-Hernangomez-against-Hawks-300x259.jpg><p><span>On 13 February 2017, he helped win over the Golden State Warriors by scoring a season-high 27 points to go with a season-best ten rebounds.</span></p><p><span>The win was 132-110. He hit six three-pointers against the Golden State Warriors to help the Nuggets tie an NBA record with 24-pointers.</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, in the 2017-2018 season, he was diagnosed with mononucleosis or ‘mono.’ As a result, he only played in 25 games during his sophomore campaign.</span></p><h3><span>Minnesota Timberwolves</span></h3><p><span>Juan was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves on 5 February 2020. Everything is relatively new, so there is less news about his place in the team.</span></p><p><span>But rest assured, he is getting along with everyone and practicing hard for the upcoming seasons.</span></p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Juan-Hernangomez-posing-e1602093573447.jpg><h3><span>Others</span></h3><p><span>According to online sources, Juan is shooting a movie with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Sandler</a>. Adam Sandler’s latest movie is Hustle, which is a Netflix-produced film; it is about an overseas scout that is searching for talent.</span></p><p><span>Because of his filming schedule, he is said to miss two weeks of the Minnesota Timberwolves’ voluntary workouts.</span></p><h2><span>Juan Hernangómez | Net Worth</span></h2><p><span>Juan is a famous basketball player who has a lot of sponsors.</span></p><p><span>According to online sources, his estimated net worth is about $4 million.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>There is no information about his salary after his draft to Minnesota Timberwolves. However, as a forward in Denver Nuggets, his salary was $2,166,360.</span></p><p><span>He was under a 4-year contract for $9,551,670. He was the ninth-best player for Denver Nuggets.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Needless to say, Juan lives a comfortable life and luxury.</span></p><h2><span>Juan Hernangómez | Player Profile&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>Juan’s playing style has been compared to other NBA players <a href=#>Victor Claver</a> and Jonas Jerebko. He has been complimented for his speed, athleticism, and 7ft (or 2.13 m) wingspan.</span></p><p><span>The pair of him and his brother Willy has also been compared to the Spanish NBA stars Marc and Pau Gasol.</span></p><p><span>Besides that, Juan has been appraised as a skilled and smooth big forward. Although he is big for his size, this does not hinder his mobility an</span><span>d coordination.</span></p><p><span>He is known to be a strong leaper with solid post moves. He is a team player and shows all-around basketball smarts and competitiveness.</span></p><p></p><p><span>However, he also has some flaws on the basketball court. He doesn’t stand out as much as his colleagues do.</span></p><p><span>He isn’t as skilled as other small forwards or powerful as other power forwards. Hence, he still needs to find his NBA niche.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Overall, he is very skilled and has a lot of potentials. Only time can tell how his career will go.</span></p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Linda Cohn Age, Salary, Net Worth, ESPN, Husband, Daughter, Instagram >></a></strong></p><h2><span>Juan Hernangómez | Personal Life</span></h2><p><span>There is no exact information about his love life in public.
