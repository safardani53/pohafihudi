Chinese mythology, and people who believe in it say that your belly button shape can even predict how many children you'll have.</p><p>Let's just say if you're after a big family, the deeper the better.</p><p>According to <a href=#>Berlin</a> psychologist Dr Gerhard Reibmann, author of Centered: Understand Yourself Through Your Navel, you can also tell how long you'll live by inspecting your navel.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN HEALTH</h2></p><p>There are some medical conditions which could mean your belly button looks a bit strange, but the NHS says that this is mostly the case for children or young infants.</p><p>It states that an umbilical hernia occurs when an internal part of the body pushes through a weakness in the muscle or surrounding tissue wall.</p><p>The NHS states: "Umbilical hernias are very common&nbsp;in infants and young children, particularly in babies born prematurely.</p><p>"An umbilical hernia appears as a painless lump in or near the navel (belly button).</p><p>"It may get bigger when laughing, coughing, crying or going to the toilet and may shrink when relaxing or lying down."</p><p>This usually corrects itself before a child's first birthday.</p><p>While there's no scientific evidence to support the idea that the shape of your belly button can predict your temperament or your lifespan, we certainly found these theories entertaining.</p><p>So if you're an adult and you're curious about what the size or shape of your belly button really means, then all you need to know is below.<br></p><h2>Protruding navel (AKA an Outie)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/000078086823_Unapprovedjpg-JS705736547.jpg><p>This type is most common in infants and young children and as we grow - the belly button usually also changes - widening.</p><p>In youngsters, they are also known as an umbilical hernia and can sometimes look like a painless lump.</p><p>They can get bigger when laughing, coughing, crying, or going to the toilet.</p><p>A belly button that sticks out demonstrates a strong, extroverted, optimistic character, who is stubborn, a fan of the limelight, and perseveres to get what they want.</p><p>People who have an outie give their beliefs and opinions a great deal of thought and stick by them.</p><p>It takes them time to find a compatible partner, but once they do their relationship is expected to be a long one.</p><p><strong>Average life expectancy:</strong> 72 years.</p><p>One woman previously revealed her <a href=#>protruding belly button</a>&nbsp;and said people should be confident in themselves to show their body parts off.</p><p>Many women develop an outie after pregnancy and are opting for surgery to change it.</p><p>The plastic surgery procedure, known as umbilicoplasty, changes the size and shape of your navel by removing or stretching the surrounding skin.</p><p>It’s popular with new mums left with an “outie” postpartum;
