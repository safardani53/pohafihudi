From his years in Navy, from his experience as terrorism and intelligence expert, Malcolm has developed a set of beliefs that he refuses to go against. But since the said beliefs are mostly based on truths, his credibility remains intact.</p><p>Moreover, Malcolm also does not have any qualms about ridiculing people if he deems them unfit for what they are. There have been times when Malcolm has downright dismissed President Trump as 'coward', 'disgrace' etc. His best selling book, in fact, was a scathing review of 2016 elections and questioned the very credibility of the election and its results, which made Donald Trump president of America.</p><p>In a more recent example, on the issue of the murder of Saudi Arabian journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, in the hands of Saudi Arabian Agents, President's National Security Advisor said that he had not listened to the audio-tape of the murder. Malcolm, in turn, deemed the Advisor a coward because he was unwilling to face the brutal truth. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><h3><strong>Malcolm Nance Married Life Suffered Hitch After Wife's Cancer Diagnosis</strong></h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Malcolm is a married man, and the identity of his wife is still a mystery to his fans and followers.

He also added that his children and his family always support him. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>See Also:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# title="Sam Rubin & Wife's Married Life Hits Serenity!
