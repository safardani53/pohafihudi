<time>22 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Broadway actor Aaron Tveit is as romantic in real life as the&nbsp;characters he&nbsp;plays&nbsp;on-screen. And so,&nbsp;when it comes to marriage, instead of getting married for the sake of it, he intends to wait till he meets the perfect girl.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Aaron Tveit Believes in The Institution of Marriage&nbsp;</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Even though he is usually&nbsp;relatively quiet about his relationship status, ‘Broadway’s favorite boyfriend’ had confessed that he wants to get&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married</a>&nbsp;somewhere down the line, which comes as no surprise considering his parents have been happily married for 40 years. Naturally, him waiting to meet the love of his life doesn’t seem unreasonable at all.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In addition to that, Tveit is a lot like Bobby, the Broadway character he plays on&nbsp;Company. Tveit calls himself an optimistic, happy, and romantic person, just like Bobby. Much like Bobby, Tveit&nbsp;too is waiting for something more when it comes to a romantic relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The actor confessed he does not believe in superficial reasons like ‘it’s time to settle down,’ to get married. Like his character Bobby, he too cares about an all-consuming love and believes that he will meet his future wife—a partner who will make him feel that way. Until then, he will happily wait.&nbsp;</p><h2>Aaron Tveit's Idea of A Perfect Date and A Perfect Partner</h2><p>In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Glamour</a>&nbsp;in 2016, the handsome Broadway actor described his perfect date night as a nice dinner followed by walking around <a href=# rel=follow>New York City</a> only to end up at ‘one of those hole-in-the-wall places.’&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Further, he admitted that he’d like to go out with someone who loves laughing, comedy, and someone he can have fun with (Ladies, take notes!).&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Talking about the best advice he had received about love and relationships, he explained that there is no point looking for it. Thanks to his friends and family who have found the great loves of their lives, he firmly believes that he’ll know when it happens.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, he also revealed that he was single and looking for a nice girl. However, he acknowledged he had gotten to the point of knowing himself well enough before committing to someone and so had been focusing on being receptive to people around him.</p><h2>Has Aaron Tveit Found The Right Girl?</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Since we're already this far into the article, asking "Is Aaron Tveit married?" would be silly, but has he found his right girl? <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Tveit might have found the ‘right girl’ he had been looking for. In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">GQ</a>&nbsp;in 2019, when he was asked about his workout regimen and dietary restrictions, the actor shared that he and his girlfriend are strict regarding their diet and eating clean. Still, they indulged in foods they rarely eat whenever they’re on a road trip.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though he did not share the name of the girl he was dating, his fans—who like to call themselves the ‘Tveitertots’—have some ideas. In an&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;post, it was revealed that the 37-year-old actor was dating Ericka Hunter. The rumored couple was seen attending a US Open match together in 2019.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In addition, in a discussion on Reddit, users were openly discussing the relationship between "Aaron Tveit and his married girlfriend Ericka Hunter." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Discussion About Aaron Tveit and his alleged girlfriend on Reddit </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Reddit</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnkZa%2FsLqMra2eoaRisaLAyKeeZp%2BZp7mnvsiepZ1mmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2faaron-tveit-dating-girlfriend-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2faaron-tveit-dating-girlfriend-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2faaron-tveit-dating-girlfriend-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2faaron-tveit-dating-girlfriend-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2faaron-tveit-dating-girlfriend-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2faaron-tveit-dating-girlfriend-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./harry-styles-adjusting-penis-pants-on-stage-video.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./harry-styles-adjusting-penis-pants-on-stage-video.html>[VIDEO] Harry Styles Adjusting Himself On Stage Caught Red Handed Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-brett-waterman-dating.html>Who is Brett Waterman Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-brett-waterman-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
