I had to be locked up in a psychiatric ward for my own protection.”</p><p>He married his second wife, actress Karen Carlson, in 1968.</p><p>She said their son Jon was “badly frightened” by his temper and the couple divorced in 1977.</p><p>By then David was a global sensation.</p><p>His initial break- through had been a major role in Clint Eastwood’s hit 1973 cop movie Magnum Force.</p><p>That led to David being cast as <a href=#>California</a> detective Hutch in the TV drama, in which he enjoyed genuine screen chemistry with his co-star Paul.</p><p>Their buddy-buddy relationship was further strengthened by the regular appearance of streetwise informant Huggy Bear, played by Antonio Fargas.</p><p>Although the show was screened for just four years in the States, it ran to 92 episodes and was such a hit globally that in Britain the Royal Family were fans.</p><p>David recalled a royal encounter from 1977: “I got Princess Margaret really smashed one afternoon.</p><p>“We closed the set down, Paul and I took her to lunch and we emptied a couple of bottles of gin.</p><p>“She told us the Queen Mother called us ‘nice boys’. The Queen Mother loved Starsky And Hutch.”</p><p>An inability to handle his drink proved to be David’s downfall.</p><p>In 1980 he married third wife Patti, who had once dated rocker guitarist Jimi Hendrix, and they had three sons.</p><p>But after one domestic incident she told police David had sat on her while she was pregnant and had given her black eyes.</p><p>David insisted he “only” hit his wife once.</p><p>He said: “There comes a point where you can’t escape yourself.</p><p>“When I was arrested in 1983 I had to deal with it. I couldn’t avoid it any longer, because I couldn’t live with myself.”</p><p>Anger management sessions helped him to control his rage, but his marriage to Patti ended in 1986.</p><img

Paul Michael Glaser’s disillusionment with Starsky And Hutch which brought the show to an end in 1979 after four series.</p><p>Despite that, he and David remained good friends.</p><p>David said: “In Paul I found a friend for life.</p><p>“We don’t work together any more but I’m interested in him as a human being.”</p><p>David appeared in several films and TV shows but never repeated the success of playing Hutch.</p><p>In 1993 he divorced his fourth wife, actress Julia Nickson, after six years together.</p><p>Their daughter China Soul, now 35, followed him on to the stage and became a successful singer.</p><p>Two years after their break-up, David tired of Los Angeles and decided to move to the UK, where he had always had plenty of fans.</p><p>Here he embraced British life, becoming an Arsenal fan and meeting his fifth and final wife, Helen Snell, when she was doing the publicity for the play Deathtrap.</p><p>He said: “We didn’t hit it off initially because I don’t like PR bull***t, so I wasn’t one of her favourite clients.”</p><p>But they fell in love and in 2004 he took British citizenship so he could live here with Helen for good.</p><p>The couple, who mainly lived in North London, married in <a href=#>Devon</a> in June 2010.</p><p>David had to keep working because he had sold his 7.5 per cent share of the rights to Starsky And Hutch for £80,000.</p><p>That was a paltry sum compared to what he could have earned when the cop show was turned into a movie starring <a href=#>Ben Stiller</a> and Owen Wilson in 2004.</p><p>David, who had a cameo role in the film, said: “I hated it.”</p><p>The critics agreed, and it was a box office flop.</p><p>In 2001 he earned some money — said to be £170,000 — in a libel case against journalist Matthew Wright after a review in which he called the play The Dead Monkey, which David was starring in, the worst he had ever seen.</p><p>It turned out Wright had not seen it and David was awarded damages.</p><p>During his time in Britain the once bad-tempered star showed a softer, more thoughtful side.</p><p>In 1997 he canvassed for <a href=#>BBC</a> journalist-turned-politician Martin Bell during his successful election campaign to unseat shamed Tory MP Neil Hamilton in Tatton, <a href=#>Cheshire</a>.</p><p>And in 2003 David spoke about his wife-beating regrets during a campaign to highlight the horror of <a href=#>domestic violence.</a></p><p>In the past few years his public appearances were restricted by a series of health problems.</p><p>Years of smoking three packets of cigarettes a day led to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p><p>Then in 2017 he fell into a coma following a general anaesthetic during a hip replacement operation.</p><p>He said: “I spent 72 days in intensive care, including twice being put on a ventilator and undergoing a tracheotomy.</p><p>“I couldn’t walk, I couldn’t do anything, I was in delirium.”</p><p>Thanks to life-saving treatment at the Royal Free Hospital in London he pulled through.</p><p>Announcing his death last night, his widow Helen said: “He shared many extraordinary gifts in the world as actor, singer, storyteller, creative artist and dear friend.</p><p>“His smile, laughter and passion for life will be remembered by the many whose lives he has touched.”</p><p>But the one thing that bugged him was that everyone just wanted to talk about Starsky And Hutch.</p><p>In 2011 he said: “I suppose I’ve mellowed a bit over the years.</p><p>“But I still can’t help getting a little twitch when I see myself credited with it.</p><p>“After all this time, that’s still the only thing I get in parentheses: ‘David Soul (Starsky and Hutch)’.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>“Obviously there is a lot more to my life than that — I’ve done a whole lot of stuff.”</p><p>That much is certainly true.</p><img

A talented actor and singer and one of the coolest people alive in the 1970s. Rest in peace David Soul.”</p><p>Another added: “David Soul of Starsky And Hutch fame has died aged 80. I particularly enjoyed watching him in Salem’s Lot, it terrifies me now as much as it did then.</p><p>“I’ve been known to belt out his classic hits Don’t Give Up On Us Baby and Silver Lady on karaoke, great actor.
