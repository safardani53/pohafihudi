Lastly, it’s about y’all, the fans, who watch and support these artists, us coaches and everyone at The Voice chasing their dreams. It wouldn’t happen without you!”</p><p>The Oklahoma native was one of the original four coaches on the show, along with <a href=#><strong>Adam Levine</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>CeeLo Green</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Christina Aguilera</strong></a>. His final season, which kicked off in March 2023, features <a href=#><strong>Niall Horan</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kelly Clarkson</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Chance the Rapper</strong></a>.</p><p>Throughout his tenure on The Voice, Shelton has secured eight total victories, including season 3’s <a href=#><strong>Cassadee Pope</strong></a> and season 4’s <a href=#><strong>Danielle Bradbery</strong></a>. As he prepares for his last competition, the “Austin” artist is <a href=#>ready for another win</a> — but he’s also looking forward to having a break.</p><p>“When I came on as a coach on this show, I mean, everything in my life was turned upside down,” Shelton told Today in February 2023. “And in a good way, you know? This has been incredible, but it’s time, you know. It’s time for not even what’s next. A little bit of nothing would be nice.”</p><p>He described how much The Voice has “changed my life,” pointing out that he met his wife, <a href=#><strong>Gwen Stefani</strong></a>, during his time on the show. (The couple <a href=#>began dating in 2015</a> and tied the knot six years later.)</p><p>The decision to <a href=#>leave his coaching chair</a> wasn’t an easy one. “He was in two minds for a while because the show has given him so much — and certainly way more than just a financial perspective,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly in October 2022, noting that<a href=#> Shelton “really agonized” over his exit</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>According to the insider, the series “helped [Blake] see the good side about living and working in Hollywood after so many years [of being] based in the south,” but he “knew it was time to leave the show and needed to move on.”</p><p>Scroll down to see how <a href=#>Voice coaches past and present</a> have reacted to Shelton’s final season:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BXuaK3xGaqoZ2cqbyvecuemK%2Bhnpx6tbTEZq2ooZOaeri0wK1knKeRmLWmv4yhmK%2BdXaiuqrCO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fblake-shelton-leaving-the-voice-what-coaches-have-said.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fblake-shelton-leaving-the-voice-what-coaches-have-said.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fblake-shelton-leaving-the-voice-what-coaches-have-said.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fblake-shelton-leaving-the-voice-what-coaches-have-said.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fblake-shelton-leaving-the-voice-what-coaches-have-said.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fblake-shelton-leaving-the-voice-what-coaches-have-said.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./carlos-rivera-19860315-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./carlos-rivera-19860315-html.html>Carlos Rivera (Pop Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mook-boy.html>Mook Boy</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mook-boy.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
