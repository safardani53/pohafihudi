Paparazzi often captured Mama June out and about, just like in the photo above. But pretty soon, she was ready to try something completely new and began to put more of a focus on her physical health and wellbeing.<p id=content-paragraph-4>After her and her daughter’s series Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, Mama June became the star of Mama June: From Not to Hot. The show chronicled the reality star’s total lifestyle evolution, and Mama June completely transformed into a total knockout. With the tools to take care of herself and make herself feel absolutely beautiful, Mama June was wholly ready to embrace a new chapter of her life.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Of course, things did take a major turn when Mama June got involved with boyfriend <strong>Geno Doak</strong>. In March 2019, June and Geno were arrested for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>possession of drugs</a>, including <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>drug paraphernalia</a>. June basically disappeared from her daughters’ lives. Fortunately, it seems like things are finally starting to turn around for the star. In December 2020, June revealed that she was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>celebrating 11 months clean</a> from drug use.</p><h2><strong>The June Family So Far</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mama-june-then-now-weight-loss-embed2.jpg>June is the matriarch of her family. She is the mother of four daughters, including <b>Anna Marie “Chickadee”</b> <strong>Cardwell</strong>, 26, <b>Jessica Louise “Chubbs” Shannon</b>, 24, <a href=#><b>Lauryn Michelle “Pumpkin” Efird</b></a>, 21, and <b>Alana “Honey Boo Boo” Thompson</b>, 15. June also has three siblings: <strong>Joanne “Doe Doe” Shannon</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Joannie Shannon</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>James Edward Shannon</strong>, all of whom have been featured in the various reality tv shows. Since rising to fame and navigating a string of difficult circumstances, June’s relationships with her family members have been strained.<p id=content-paragraph-7>During a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>February 22 preview</a> for&nbsp;Road To Redemption, the pain that her family experienced was evident. “You don’t know how many nights I’ve cried myself to sleep,” Alana said through tears. But June has been determined to prove that she is committed to staying healthy and being there for her family. “I’ve got to continuously show&nbsp;Pumpkin that I’ve changed,” June said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Circumstances have, though, been tough on June’s family. “These last few years have been hell on our crazy family,”&nbsp; daughter Lauryn “Pumpkin” Shannon shared. “I don’t even know who my mother is anymore,” she confessed. But as the trailer continued to go on, it was clear that there were deliberate actions taken to get June back on track. “She just wants us all to go back to the way things used to be,” Pumpkin went on. However, Pumpkin did share a final, ominous warning. “But, after destroying our family, we don’t know if we want her in our lives,” she said. Only time will tell how June and her family rectify their strained relationships.</p><h2><strong>Complete Timeline</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mama-june-then-now-weight-loss-embed3.jpg><a href=#><strong>Toddlers & Tiaras</strong></a>: Mama June rose to fame on the TLC series&nbsp;Toddlers & Tiaras.

June and Geno are still awaiting the next steps on their criminal trial sentence, and June was clearly unnerved by the whole situation in a new preview from&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Road To Redemption</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>“That was our lawyer that just called, and we have to be at court in the morning,” she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>says in the preview</a>. “And you know that DA over there does not like you at all,” she further explained to her boyfriend. Naturally, Geno was concerned about the whole ordeal, too. “Are they trying to pull some sh*t to get us over there to lock us up? Less than 24 hours notice, that’s not how sh*t normally works. What if we go to jail?”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>The reality of the situation settled in for June, when she revealed in her confessional that she is “facing a couple years,” in jail. “Geno’s facing 10 years. We may not even get to see each other. I’m kind of like freaking the hell out. We don’t know what to expect in the morning.” Still, June is adamant about how <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the two have changed</a>. “We changed our life around, but we still got caught with dope. We screwed up. There’s consequences to that,” Geno told his girlfriend. Time will tell how Mama June’s situation will pan out.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Mama June: Road to Redemption&nbsp;premieres on Friday, March 19 at 9 PM ET/PT on WE tv.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8yapJplmqq7pnnToZynZZ6kxG68x6irqKtdaX52hJNvcGg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmama-june-then-now-photos-4158469.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmama-june-then-now-photos-4158469.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmama-june-then-now-photos-4158469.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmama-june-then-now-photos-4158469.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmama-june-then-now-photos-4158469.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmama-june-then-now-photos-4158469.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./emma-chamberlain-boyfriend-5087166.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./emma-chamberlain-boyfriend-5087166.html>Meet Her Man Tucker Pillsbury &amp;amp; 2 Exes Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nessa-barrett-lana-del-rey-blackbear.html>Fans Want Nessa Barrett, Lana Del Rey, and Blackbear Collab</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./nessa-barrett-lana-del-rey-blackbear.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
