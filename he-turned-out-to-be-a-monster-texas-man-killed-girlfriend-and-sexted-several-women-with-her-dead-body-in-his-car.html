The woman’s decomposing body was found on May 19 in a remote area of Farmersville, Texas. She had been wrapped in a sheet and partially covered with bubble wrap.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During the trial, prosecutors alleged that Lowe had sexted at least five women and sent some of the women naked photos of himself. When Lowe took the stand, he testified that he had never acted on the texts. His attorney compared his sexual behavior to drug addiction.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During his testimony, Lowe took the stand and claimed that he had accidentally slipped and pushed Bardwell while they were having sex in the shower on May 1. He said she first hit her head on the wall and then on the edge of the bathtub, according to trial records obtained by PEOPLE. Lowe claimed that he and Bardwell had voluntarily taken the the date rape drug GHB as an aphrodisiac.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lowe claimed that Bardwell sustained a cut to her forehead and felt dizzy. According to Lowe, they took more GHB before taking a nap.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>• Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage? </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1><strong>Click here</strong></a><strong> to get breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases in the True Crime Newsletter.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lowe said that he awoke and found Bardwell dead. He put her body in the trunk of his car, parked it in his garage in Richardson and on May 9 dumped her in a wooded area.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I should have called someone,” he testified. “I should have called police.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When asked by his defense attorney why he didn’t call 911, he responded: “I was scared.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jae S. Lee/The Dallas Morning News/AP</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Through tears, he told the jury that he knew that not reporting her death was wrong but he didn’t have the courage to contact police. “I was too weak,” he said. “I really made things worse.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bardwell’s family reported her missing on May 9 — more than a week after she died — after they didn’t hear from her on Mother’s Day. While the medical examiner was unable to determine how, exactly, Bardwell died, they determined she was a victim of foul play.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The coroner said the cause of death was homicidal violence,” Richardson Police Sgt. Kevin Perlich said in Aug. 2016, according to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Sun Herald</a>. “That’s the cause of death listed on the death certificate.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>• PEOPLE’s special edition True Crime Stories: 35 Real Cases That Inspired the Show Law & Order is <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>on sale now</a>.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During the trial, prosecutor Wes Wynne presented evidence that Lowe continued sexting the other women after Bardwell was dead, which prosecutors say displayed a lack of remorse. “Jessie thought she’d met [the] love of her life,” Wynne said during closing arguments. “He turned out to be a monster.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Lowe faced a life sentence, the prosecution and defense agreed to cap Lowe’s sentence at 50 years if he would tell authorities where to find Bardwell’s body, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dallas Morning News</a> reports.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lowe’s defense attorney, Andrew Farkas, did not immediately return PEOPLE’s request for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5Ontq6xjqGcZqylp7umsIyorK1lpKR6o7GMmmSmp56owaa%2BjK2csZmjYrqiuoykoKWklZl6qLXRpZ2roZWjsW6tzZ1krJ2oqbKledKerZ6qkaF6uLvMnqVmr5mptW60xKtknZ2RmXqju8OyZKKmXZ22tHnCmqlo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhe-turned-out-to-be-a-monster-texas-man-killed-girlfriend-and-sexted-several-women-with-her-dead-body-in-his-car.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhe-turned-out-to-be-a-monster-texas-man-killed-girlfriend-and-sexted-several-women-with-her-dead-body-in-his-car.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhe-turned-out-to-be-a-monster-texas-man-killed-girlfriend-and-sexted-several-women-with-her-dead-body-in-his-car.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhe-turned-out-to-be-a-monster-texas-man-killed-girlfriend-and-sexted-several-women-with-her-dead-body-in-his-car.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhe-turned-out-to-be-a-monster-texas-man-killed-girlfriend-and-sexted-several-women-with-her-dead-body-in-his-car.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhe-turned-out-to-be-a-monster-texas-man-killed-girlfriend-and-sexted-several-women-with-her-dead-body-in-his-car.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./wayland-flowers.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./wayland-flowers.html>Wayland Flowers</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./laurent-dagenais-sghh-html.html>Laurent Dagenais (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./laurent-dagenais-sghh-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
