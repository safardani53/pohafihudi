A bit of cut in the ground would be ideal.</p><p>“He has a lot of talent. He was second in a Grade 1 at Kempton as a novice. Last season he was plagued by sore shins but he is over that and he is in good form.</p><p>“He has got his confidence back so should have a live chance.”</p><p>The horse has proved he handles the Chepstow undulations too by winning a 16-runner novice hurdle at the track in 2019.</p><p>Stable jockey Brendan Powell will ride the horse.</p><p>Kim’s son, Freddie Gingell, aged 16, is enjoying a great first season as a jockey with Paul Nicholls.</p><p>Tizzard said his nephew would have been in line for a ride in the race if the stable had run more horses in the Welsh National.</p><p>After his first victory as a jockey in February, Freddie said: “It means so much. I lost mum two years ago and she’s up there looking down.”</p><p>This is the first season Tizzard has held the sole trainer’s licence following the retirement of his father, Colin, who is still involved in running the yard. Tizzard snr famously won the Welsh National twice with Native River in 2016 and Elegant Escape in 2018.</p><p>Tizzard also reports Eldorado Allen remains on course to run in the King George at Kempton on Boxing Day.</p><p>Tizzard said: “He needs to improve a lot to win it but there is no reason he can’t be placed.</p><p>“It looks an open race compared to some years and he always runs his race. He’s shown in big races this season already he can figure in races just like this. It would be silly not to let him have a crack!”</p><p><strong>Coral Welsh Grand National odds</strong></p><p>5-1 Quick Wave</p><p>8-1 Ask Me Early, The Big Dog, Pats Fancy</p><p>10-1 The Galloping Bear, Gericault Roque</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>12-1 Royale Pagaille</p><p>14-1 The Big Breakaway, Secret Reprieve, Ashtown Lad</p><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>FREE BETS <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GET OVER £2,000 IN SIGN UP OFFERS HERE</a></h4><p>Commercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+.
