He can’t stop smiling.”</p><p>Posting a pic with his girlfriend on Instagram last month, Gene drew comparisons with famous rock ’n’ roll couples Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen and Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NINTCHDBPICT000534256049-2-e1583020214749.jpg><p>And the fact both those romances ended tragically didn’t seem to bother him.</p><p>Heroin addict Sid was charged with murdering Nancy in a hotel room in 1978 but died of an overdose before his trial, while Nirvana legend Kurt, also a heroin addict, killed himself in 1994.</p><p>But Gene — Liam’s son with All Saints sing­er Nicole Appleton — gushed: “Happy Valentine from the two biggest outlaws in the world... Sid and Nancy, K and C, adore and more, love, love, love.”</p><p>My source added: “Gene clearly sees the two of them as partners in crime, even if his choice of romantic idols here might be a bit unfortunate.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NINTCHDBPICT000567185140-e1583020540432.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NINTCHDBPICT000567185166-e1583020310117.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NINTCHDBPICT000567185149-e1583020731165.jpg><p>News of the relationship comes after Gene’s cousin Anais Gallagher went public about dating Instagram-famous farmer Julius Roberts.</p><p>But I imagine given the pair’s history, Noel's daughter won’t be getting in touch with Gene to congratulate him after he sniped: “U look like ur dad with a blonde wig on.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NINTCHDBPICT000502801523.jpg><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Review</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000562532410-e1583019162776-2.jpg><p>IT’S pretty brave to swagger on stage, wind up the crowd then announce your first song with: “This is a new one!”</p><p>That’s what frontman Grian Chatten of Mercury Prize nominees Fontaines DC did at the Brixton Academy last week.</p><p>Fans bayed for hits from their debut album Dogrel, but were made to wait as they played new material first.</p><p>The Irish band kicked into life in the last 30 minutes with anthems Boys In The Better Land, Hurricane Laughter and Too Real.</p><p>There are definite similarities between the sulky singer and a young Liam Gallagher, as he marched up and down the stage like a man possessed.</p><p>Finishing with raucous hit Big, they definitely saved their best til last.</p><h2>Lipa's over-Dua top Glasto set</h2><p>DUA Lipa is to headline The Other Stage at ­Glastonbury this year, I can reveal.</p><p>My sources say Dua, who releases her second album Future Nostalgia in April, has just been signed for the Worthy Farm gig.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000562532410-e1583019162776-2.jpg><p>And they say the decision to have her top the bill on The Other Stage was made by co-organiser Emily Eavis in a bid to increase the number of female headliners.</p><p>One said: “There was definitely an argument to say Dua should have been on the Pyramid Stage, but Emily wanted to have her on board as a headliner.</p><p>“She wants male and female artists to be equally prominent on the festival’s bill this year.</p><p>“Dua’s fans will be thrilled and she’s looking forward to putting on a show to remember.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NINTCHDBPICT000567164050.jpg><p>The pop beauty – who soaked up the Glasto atmosphere with other revellers last year, and performed on the John Peel Stage in 2017 – put on a good show this weekend as she partied with fans at the Mardi Gras ­celeb­rations in Sydney, Australia.</p><p>And though she clearly got into the spirit of the occasion, her outfit made her look a bit overdressed next to her pals in Speedos.</p><p>Sam Smith, who also turned up, had a similar problem thanks to a tie-dyed suit jacket.
