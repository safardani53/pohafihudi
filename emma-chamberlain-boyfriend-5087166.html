From her<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> viral interview</a> with&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jack Harlow</a>&nbsp;</strong>to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>fangirling</a> over&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gigi Hadid</strong></a> on the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2022 red carpet</a>, it’s no wonder why everyone is obsessed with the 21-year-old beauty. Emma rose to fame in 2017 after she uploaded her first <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>YouTube video</a> and has since not slowed down. With over 12 million YouTube subscribers and 16 million Instagram followers, Emma is clearly one of the most successful internet personalities.

Learn all about the duo’s low-key romance below!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Emma-Chamberlain-Boyfriend-SS-embed.jpg><h2>Who Is Emma Chamberlain’s Boyfriend?</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Although Emma might be famous herself, her boyfriend is no stranger to fame either. Tucker, who is a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>singer</a> known by the name Role Model, has been making music since 2017 and continues to rise to the top of the charts. The 25-year-old is originally from Maine and has released three EPs and one full-length album thus far. Tucker’s most recent album,&nbsp;Rx, was released in 2022, and even features his leading lady in his <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>music video</a> for “neverletyougo.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>During a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Valentine’s Day</a> interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>GQ </a>in 2023, the pair joked that the 2022 music video was their “soft” launch to the world. “My dad always says that me and Tucker are soft-launched,” she joked to the outlet at the time. She added that the music video cameo, “was so soft launch. Tucker, be honest, that was a soft launch.” Despite this, Emma and Tucker did not explicitly confirm she was the brunette in the video. “There’s no proof that she was there,” he joked. “Yeah, there’s no proof,” she added. “It was a clone. Tucker’s been cloning me. Put that&nbsp;on the record: ‘Tucker’s cloning me.’ I’m kidding.”</p><h2>When Did Emma Chamberlain & Tucker Pillsbury Start Dating?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Although their exact timeline is not known, it is speculated that the lovebirds began dating in early 2022, around the time that the “neverletyougo” video premiered. Notably, and in true Emma fashion, they made their official red carpet debut at the&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vanity Fair&nbsp;Oscars after party</a> in Mar. 2022. Emma declared that their “hard launch” was being on the cover of&nbsp;GQ&nbsp;in Feb. 2023, which Tucker featured on his Instagram. “happy v day @gq,” he captioned the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>carousel of snapshots</a> from their loved-up photoshoot.</p><h2>What The Couple Has Said About Each Other</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The California native and her man do keep a relatively private romance, despite having a few interviews together. At the time of their&nbsp;GQ&nbsp;interview, they also did a sweet <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“couple’s quiz” video</a> for the outlet, which has over 3.2 million views on YouTube and counting. Tucker nearly got himself into hot water when Emma asked him what city she grew up in and she wasn’t 100% sure on the answer. “I know it’s where the airport is!”, he quipped, before adding, “San bbb [sic] Bruno!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Tucker also explained to the outlet why they stay out of the spotlight, for the most part. “We just are trying to be professional within our own careers,” he shared. “We had conversations about it from the start. My goal was to never be able to attribute my success or anything to someone else. I was always very proud of what I had built, so I was very scared I was just going to lose that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>His girlfriend, however, is a bit tired of being “secret” of their romance. “I know that people are going to be like, ‘Emma, you’re a f****** hypocrite,’ because I always said this is something I will never do,” she said to the outlet. “There’s parts of our relationship that are going to be private forever, and those things we keep sacred. But I don’t think we need to be secret anymore. It’s just like, I’m over that s***.”</p><h2>Emma’s Past Romances</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Prior to her committed relationship with the “a little more time” hitmaker, Emma was linked to two other internet sensations. In 2020, Emma told her YouTube followers that she <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“liked this guy”</a> and although she did not name him, many linked her to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Aaron Hull</strong></a>. By Sept. of that year, Aaron posted a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>YouTube video</a> noting what happened in their brief romance. “Distance and everything, the formula was just too hard. I think, from my point of view,” he said at the time. “No, I did not cheat on Emma and I would not ever want to have a bad ending with Emma, but at that point, it was out of my hands.” And before her brief fling with Aaron, Emma was linked to YouTuber&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ethan Dolan</strong></a>, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>J-14</a>. The sparked dating rumors in 2018, however, neither of them ever confirmed if it was true.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8SmpJplk52urq7Eq6OaoZ5ir7DFxaugnqaUYoJxhJZqbW9n</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2femma-chamberlain-boyfriend-5087166.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2femma-chamberlain-boyfriend-5087166.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2femma-chamberlain-boyfriend-5087166.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2femma-chamberlain-boyfriend-5087166.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2femma-chamberlain-boyfriend-5087166.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2femma-chamberlain-boyfriend-5087166.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./miya-lashaes-boyfriend-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./miya-lashaes-boyfriend-list.html>Miya Lashaes Boyfriend: Who is Miya Lashae Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mama-june-then-now-photos-4158469.html>June Shannon Then and Now Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mama-june-then-now-photos-4158469.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
