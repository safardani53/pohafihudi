The winner of Taskmaster has struggled a lot with his health. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But now, he is comfortable with it and is in&nbsp;a good place talking about it. So here is&nbsp;everything about Gamble, his weight loss journey, and his life with diabetes.</p><h2>Ed Gamble's Weight Loss Journey&nbsp;</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Gamble was a bit on the heavier side when he was young. He was the same when he initially started doing stand-up comedy.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But when he was in his early 20s, he realized he had to lose weight. He was booking more gigs and thought, "it might be nice to shed a few pounds." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>That was when he started his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">weight loss</a> journey.&nbsp;He opted for a minimal diet and started exercising. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Similarly, he started running to aid in his weight loss.&nbsp;Soon, he started losing a lot of weight.</p><p>Gamble confessed he did not do "a crazy crash diet." Instead, he&nbsp;simply stopped binge eating and drinking, which helped the initial stages of his weight loss. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But after "getting into exercise," he realized he enjoyed doing so. Previously, he&nbsp;weighed&nbsp;19 stone, equivalent to 120.6&nbsp;kgs and 266 lbs.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><br><strong>Ed Gamble, who is diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, enjoys dessert.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>But after his weight loss journey, he shed six stones aka, 38kgs or 84lbs, in just a couple of months. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Ed Gamble and Diabetes&nbsp;</h2><p>The comedian discussed his journey with diabetes in an interview with <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Health Awareness</a> in November 2019. He first found out that he had diabetes when he was 13 years old.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He discovered it after he was "constantly thirsty and drinking a lot of water." As a consequence of that, he used to go to the washroom a lot.</p><p>His mother realized that something was going on with her son. Getting constantly thirsty was a sign of having a high blood sugar level.&nbsp;</p><p>Gamble's mom being a nurse, noticed it and got it checked. After that, Gamble was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The comedian considers being diagnosed with the disease at a young age as "something of an advantage." This was because he could adapt to the lifestyle at 13, making it easier for him now.</p><p>He confessed that it would be tough to keep track of himself if he were to be diagnosed at the age of 33. Similarly, it would be more difficult for him and his career.&nbsp;</p><p>To be at his healthiest, Gamble has to keep track of his blood sugar level. For this, he does not need to do the traditional method of pricking is fingers and testing his blood sample. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Instead, he uses a "constant blood glucose monitor" whose sensor in his stomach sends the reading. They are sent through a transmitter on his skin, directly to an app on his phone.&nbsp;</p><p>Using those readings, he can alter his food intake and insulin. This way, he has been coping with his diabetes.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ2UYrSiucGlnGavlZ60qcCMpaasq12ZtqKuxK2crGaYqbqt</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fed-gamble-weight-loss-diabetes-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fed-gamble-weight-loss-diabetes-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fed-gamble-weight-loss-diabetes-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fed-gamble-weight-loss-diabetes-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fed-gamble-weight-loss-diabetes-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fed-gamble-weight-loss-diabetes-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./naomi-watts-billy-crudup-spark-engagement-speculation-ring-pic.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./naomi-watts-billy-crudup-spark-engagement-speculation-ring-pic.html>Naomi Watts, Billy Crudup Spark Engagement Speculation: Ring Pic</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jamal-bryant-kids.html>He's Rumored to Have at Least Six, if Not More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jamal-bryant-kids.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
