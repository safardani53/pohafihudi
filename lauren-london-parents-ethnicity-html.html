She added, "And then I'd spend the summer with my dad and be sent to all white summer camps where I was 'that Black girl.'"</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Lauren admitted that prompted confusion that she struggled with "for about a minute,"&nbsp;but after a while, "I figured it out for myself."</p><p>London now does not let others define herself. If someone thinks she was not "Black enough," it was their issue and not hers. She further explained, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I’m okay with who I am and it is what is. I’m a Black woman like my mother, and I love who my father is, and I love both sides of me.
