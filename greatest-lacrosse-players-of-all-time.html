Thrope was an all-rounder athlete whom the Associated Press ranked as the “greatest athlete” from the first 50 years of the 20th century.</p><p>Some might argue that Thrope played lacrosse only in his high school. However, that does not make him any less the greatest lacrosse player.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Jim-thorpe.jpg><p>We rarely come across legendary athletes like Thrope. There is only a handful of athletes who are versatile athletes like him. Consequently, to honor this legendary athlete, the town of Him Thrope, Pennsylvania, was named after him.</p><h3>8. Dave Pietramala</h3><p>Dave Pietramala is widely regarded as one of the best defensemen in the history of lacrosse.

At the International Lacrosse Federation World Championship, he won two world championships.</p><p>After retiring from his playing career, he began coaching. Pietramala is inducted into the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame.</p><h3>7. Oren Lyons</h3><p>On number 7 of the greatest lacrosse players of all time, we have Oren Lyons. He was born in 1930 and is a Native American Faithkeeper of the Turtle Clan. He was one of the most recognized lacrosse players at Syracuse University.</p><p>Lyons attended the University on an athletic scholarship in lacrosse. While attending the University, his academic and athletic accomplishments earned him the Orange Key award.

He was the first freshman in the University’s history to be named a First Team All-American.</p><p>During his college lacrosse career, he leads the University to several championships and wins. Powell’s decision gave quite a surprise to the lacrosse community when he decided not to play the sport for the Major League Lacrosse (MLL) in 2004.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Michael-Powell-lacrosse-all-stars.webp><p>However, in 2005, Powell joined the MLL after Baltimore Bayhawks drafted him. Similarly, he was part of the U.S. World Team that played in the 2006 World Lacrosse Championship.</p><p>He was the leading scorer on the U.S. team. Currently, Powell is a singer/songwriter and visual artist.</p><h3>5. Paul Rabil</h3><p>On number 5, we have 38 year-old former American professional lacrosse player Paul Rabil. He played collegiate lacrosse at Johns Hopkins University.</p><p>In the 2008 Major League Lacrosse Collegiate Draft, Boston Cannons drafted Rabil the first overall. While playing for the team, he received several accolades like MLL Offensive Player of the Year, First-Team All-Pro, MLL First-Team All-Pro, etc.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Paul-Rabil-lacrosse.jpg><p>Rabil also played for the National Lacrosse League (NLL) and Premier Lacrosse League (PLL), which he founded with his brother, Mike Rabil.

Consequently, the rules were changed to players required to keep their sticks in constant motion when carrying the ball.
