He was completely unpretentious.

It could have gone in the car park.”</p><p>That it didn’t, that it flew into the top corner, turned this jobbing chippy into a footballing icon.</p><p>Tomorrow night, the BBC cameras will be back at Edgar Street to cover Hereford’s first-round clash with League One Portsmouth.</p><p>That Hereford is the club of Radford made it such an obvious choice for live national broadcast. Half a century later, the memories never dim.</p><p>Motson said: “That was one of the greatest moments in FA Cup history and it was also one of the best moments of my life — because once that goal hit the back of the net, my career took off.</p><p>“That pitch invasion was an eruption of spontaneous joy.
