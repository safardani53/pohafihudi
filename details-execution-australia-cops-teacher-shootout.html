Train at a property in a remote part of <a href=#>Queensland </a>after his family reported him missing.</p><p>McCrow and Arnold honked their horn to alert the residents of the house near Wieambilla of their presence.</p><p>But when there was no sign of anyone inside, the four officers got out of their cars and jumped over the locked fence.</p><p>They then came under a hail of gunfire from inside as they walked up the driveway at about 4pm local time on Monday.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON AUSTRALIA ">READ MORE ON AUSTRALIA</h2><p>The bullets that descended on the four officers are believed to have been fired by Nathaniel, Gareth and Stacey Train.</p><p>After the officers were shot the gunmen dressed in camouflage fired further bullets into their bodies then took their guns.</p><p>A neighbour who ran to investigate, Alan Dare, 58, was killed in crossfire</p><p>Gareth, Nathaniel and Stacey Train were killed in a subsequent gunfight with Special Operations officers.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>It’s emerged that Gareth Train was a conspiracy theorist who hated cops and believed an infamous Australian massacre was a “false flag operation”, <a href=#>according to The Guardian.</a></p><p>He claimed the Port Arthur Massacre was designed to “disarm the Australian population” and bizarrely asserted the government was running “re-education camps”.</p><p>The officers killed were responding to a request from their New South Wales counterparts in the search for Nathaniel.</p><p>Two other police officers Constable Keely Brough and Constable Randall Kirk, both aged 28, also came under fire but managed to escape.</p><p>Kirk was shot in the leg while Brough fled into the bush pursued by the gunmen.</p><p>Locals reported sporadic gunfire throughout the night, culminating in an intense firefight in which the three shooters were killed.</p><p>Queensland police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, said there had been “a lot of ammunition and weaponry” at the property and that the dead officers “did not stand a chance”.</p><p>The 46-year-old was last seen on December 16, 2021 but was still in contact with family members until October 9 this year.</p><p>He was a former school principal in Queensland’s far north until a heart attack and a cheating row, the Daily Mail reports.</p><p>One student, who may have been related to a teaching assistant, was unable to answer the first two questions in a test but then got all of the remaining 34 questions correct.</p><p>Train allegedly raised the alarm about the incident at his own school but sought help from a politician when he claimed the NSW Education Department had ignored him.</p><p>Train kept pursuing the cheating row with education officials in a series of increasingly frustrated emails.</p><p>He suffered a massive heart attack at the school in August last year. and was saved by teachers who rushed to his aid.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Stacey Train was listed as the Head of Curriculum at nearby Tara
