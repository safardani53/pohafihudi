I’d get sexist jokes — things like, ‘Why aren’t you doing the teas or washing our kits?’”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE CRICKET NEWS">READ MORE CRICKET NEWS</h2><p>And glamorous fast bowler Lauren gets more comments on social media for the way she looks rather than her cricket skills. She says:</p><p>“Some of the comments are a bit gross. I don’t get anything nasty, but it sticks with me.”</p><p>Sophie is also hoping that record crowds and more time in the spotlight for the women’s game will see more of a link-up with the men’s team.&nbsp;</p><p>She said: “We love seeing when the men’s players support us. Women’s cricket is getting bigger and bigger now.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Cricket</h2></p><p>"And you’ve seen the male footballers supporting the women so hopefully it will start happening more now."</p><p>The talented trio are proud to be figureheads for the women’s game.</p><p>Lauren says: “When I was playing in the World Cup in <a href=#>South Africa</a> in February, me and Soph had our hair in plaits, and when we came home there were these little girls who’d come to watch us, and they’d had with their hair done the same way.</p><p>“We spoke to them and they were like, ‘You’re really girly and you play cricket and bowl fast!’”</p><p>And it is not just young girls among the fans.</p><p>The women will take to the field for today’s second One Day International at The Ageas Bowl in <a href=#>Southampton</a>, in a crunch match with Australia in the race to win the Ashes.</p><p>Here, we introduce three of the bright lights in England’s team.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>'I’d show the boys in the opposition who’s boss'</h2><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>Sophie Ecclestone, 24, from Cheshire</strong></p><p>LEFT-ARM spinner Sophie has already established herself as one of the best in the game.</p><p>She is the holder of the record for most international wickets taken by an England bowler.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sophie-ecclestone-england-bowls-womens-831263330.jpg><p>Remarkably, in the Test match against the Aussies Sophie took ten wickets — five in each innings.</p><p>She has added five more wickets in the T20Is and grabbed one wicket in the first ODI.</p><p>Sophie was introduced to the game by her brother James, 29, and made her England debut aged 17.</p><p>She said: “I started playing when I was quite young and joined Oldham cricket club.</p><p>“I was the only girl in the team and I think the opposition found it quite daunting.</p><p>“They’d be like, ‘There’s a girl playing,’ and then I’d show them who’s boss.</p><p>“Now that more women are playing, and we’ve got a name for ourselves, it’s ­getting a bit better. Sadly we still need to do more.</p><p>“One of my friends, who is wicket keeper for <a href=#>Lancashire</a>, did a really good take on it and it went viral.</p><p>“I saw a comment which said, ‘I don’t like women’s cricket but this is amazing.’</p><p>“Who cares if it’s women’s cricket? Why don’t you just say it’s amazing.”</p><p>And Sophie reckons the ladies come under harsher scrutiny.</p><p>She says: “When I was younger I was a bit of a tomboy but I love getting all dressed up now.</p><p>“If I post something on my social media I’ll get comments or messages from people saying, ‘Why are you all dressed up — you should be concentrating on your next game.’</p><p>“Say we have our hair done — the men get theirs done and don’t get the comments we get.</p><p>“Women’s sport is such a massive thing. Just look at the <a href=#>Lionesses</a>.</p><p>“They have shown us how it’s done, and hopefully we can follow their lead.”</p><p>Sophie, who plays golf in her spare time and follows Everton FC, is single again after breaking off an engagement a year ago.</p><p>She jokes: “I wouldn’t mind finding a golfer — that would be lovely. I’m having great fun being single. I’m a strong, independent woman.”</p><p>And of the women’s rise in popularity, she says: “Tickets are affordable to watch our games, which I know was important to the Lionesses.</p><p>“We had 20,000 watching recently and seeing loads of girls there wanting your autograph, it’s about inspiring the next generation.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>'The cricket club was our first stop after I was born'</h2><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>Sarah Glenn, 23, from Derby</strong></p><p>BUBBLY Sarah made her England debut aged 19 but got her first taste of cricket on the day she was born.</p><p>On the way home from the hospital, her parents stopped off at their local cricket club.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sarah-glenn-england-catches-ball-830499169.jpg><p>The leg spin bowler said: “My love for cricket was something that happened from day dot. On the weekend I was born, the ladies team were having a party and, as my parents were driving back from the hospital with me, they went past the cricket club. Everyone was like, ‘Pop in.’</p><p>“It was actually the first place I visited when I was born.”</p><p>Sarah is a fan favourite and wowed crowds during the first Ashes T20 at Edgbaston, by taking two wickets in two balls as well as taking the catch that removed Aussie captain and opener Alyssa Healy.</p><p>Footage of Sarah’s sensational spell went viral but should come as no surprise.</p><p>In 2021 she was the joint-leading wicket-taker during England’s <a href=#>New</a> <a href=#>Zealand </a>tour.</p><p>Like many England stars, Sarah began by playing men’s cricket and was the only girl on her team, Denby Cricket Club in Derbyshire.</p><p>While she felt accepted by her team-mates, many of whom she had grown up with, she got her fair share of grief from opposition players.</p><p>She said: “They’d bowl a bit slower because they didn’t think you could take it. But then you’d hit a four and they’d get annoyed and bowl a bit faster and try to hit you on the head.</p><p>“They were a bit predictable as they didn’t want to be shown up by a girl.</p><p>“Luckily I had such a ­supportive environment and those kinds of comments just fuelled me on.”</p><p>Sarah has been dating accounts worker Jordan Sergeant, 23, for 18 months and she insists he is happy to be the “Hab” of an England cricket star.</p><p>She says: “He loves it. He plays local cricket which is nice because he gets the game.</p><p>“He loves nothing more than coming to watch us all play.</p><p>“Cricket is tough mentally. We’re touring 24/7 and often you have more bad days than good, but he’s so supportive.”</p><p>And Sarah relishes her position as a role model to younger girls starting out.</p><p>She said: “I get so many messages and have had ­conversations with parents saying how much I’ve helped, as we always talk about what we went through.</p><p>“It’s about trying to remove the stigma a little bit.</p><p>“Women’s cricket has come a long way but there’s still a long way to go.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>'I like dressing girly and doing my make-up – and that’s OK'</h2><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>Lauren Bell, 23, from Berkshire</strong></p><p>FAST bowler Lauren made her England debut last summer after having to choose between football and cricket.</p><p>She said: “When I was about 16 my parents were like, ‘You need to pick one sport to ­concentrate on. We can’t keep taking you to both’.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bc1e251e-14e1-4c64-bcce-702213289f84.jpg><p>“I was playing at a high level in both sports and I chose cricket, which seems to have been a good decision.”</p><p>Lauren has been a key part of England’s attack, taking nine wickets in the Test Match, three T20Is and first ODI of the seven-game series.</p><p>At 6ft tall, Lauren has the willowy looks of a supermodel and is nicknamed The Shard, after the ­London skyscraper.</p><p>But as a proud “girly girl”, she insists the stereotype that women’s sport is for tomboys is outdated.</p><p>Lauren said: “You can look however you want and go out and bowl really fast and be really competitive.</p><p>“There are so many different women in our team. There’s someone for all the young girls out there to look up to.</p><p>“I like dressing really girly and doing my make-up and that’s OK.”</p><p>And the girls know how to have fun in their downtime.</p><p>Lauren says: “When we go out we’re just girls on a night out.</p><p>“We’re disciplined but you need to be able to celebrate and make the most of where you are in the world.”</p><p>And with all the travelling, Lauren is happy to focus on her job as a professional cricketer.</p><p>She says: “I’m just so content. I love travelling and not having to worry about anyone.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“I love my job and feel so lucky. I see what the football Lionesses have done and it’s so incredible but I think, as women, we’re all in it together.”</p><ul><li><strong>Sophie, Lauren and Sarah will be playing in the sold out Metro Bank Women's Ashes We Got Game ODI series - tune in on Sky Sports Cricket or across BBC Sport.
