<time>01 Jan 0001, 00:00</time></div></div><p>MOVIES have been used as a great way to get into the holiday spirit for decades with staples such as It’s a Wonderful Life and Miracle on 34th Street.</p><p>These films have become an essential part of the <a href=#>holiday</a> as families gather around to watch them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/scout-willis-bruce-willis-victoria-784357142.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/2810a243-1b87-4557-81cc-743b3b86ac14.jpg><p>However, no movie has sparked heavy debate each year as John McTiernan’s 1988 action classic, <a href=#>Die Hard</a>.</p><p>Whenever <a href=#>Christmas</a> season rolls around, <a href=#>legions of fans argue</a> about whether or not the film starring <a href=#>Bruce Willis</a> is a Christmas movie.</p><p>It got so bad that YouGov, a market research company, put out a poll two years ago hoping to settle the debate once and for all but even then the results were <a href=# aria-label="determined by a very slim margin (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">determined by a very slim margin</a>.</p><p>In the end, 47 percent of people who saw the movie believed that it was not a Christmas film, compared to 44 percent who thought otherwise.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE MOVIES">READ MORE MOVIES</h2><p>However, the debates haven’t stopped and there are plenty of arguments proving why this film is often named one of the best Christmas movies of all time.</p><h2>THE FILM’S PLOT</h2><p>One could argue that Die Hard is simply about a man coming home for the holidays - just with explosions.</p><p>The film follows <a href=#>New York City</a> Detective John McClane (Willis) traveling to Los Angeles, <a href=#>California</a> on <a href=#>Christmas Eve</a> as he hopes to reconcile with his estranged wife, Holly.&nbsp;</p><p>It sounds like your average Hallmark movie until the building hosting a corporate Christmas party - where McClane’s wife, Holly, is located - is seized by radical German terrorists led by Hans Gruber, played by the late <a href=#>Alan Rickman</a>.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>The plot was actually based on Roderick Thorp’s 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever about a retired private eye who reunites with his estranged daughter and grandchildren in similar fashion.</p><p>The film was re-tiled Die Hard by co-producer Joel Silver and underwent several rewrites before hitting the big screen.&nbsp;</p><h2>IMPORTANCE OF FAMILY</h2><p>A film is only as good as its protagonist and fans everywhere love John McClane.</p><p>Playing the tough-as-nails everyman, it was easy to fall in love with Willis’ character, especially when he’s on a noble adventure <a href=#>to save his family</a>.</p><p>The holidays are the perfect time for families to come together and enjoy each other’s company, making it easy to relate with McClane.</p><p>McClane fights for his family’s safety throughout the film while also working to fix his marriage, giving him the motivation to fight through hordes of henchmen.</p><p>It’s hard not to feel emotional when a bloodied and battered McClane begs LAPD Sgt Al Powell through a walkie-talkie to find his wife if he doesn’t make it.</p><p>“Tell her…that she’s the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me,” said McClane. “She’s heard me say ‘I love you’ a thousand times…she never heard me say ‘I’m sorry.’”</p><h2>THE PERFECT VILLAIN</h2><p>Even the cheeriest Christmas movie has a villain, usually one that prioritizes greed and materialism - two words that fit the sociopathic Hans Gruber.</p><p>Gruber fits the quintessential stereotype of a holiday villain: here’s there to steal money similar to what Old Man Potter does in <a href=#>It’s a Wonderful Life</a>.</p><p>Unlike McClane who is a simple family man, Gruber is flashier and more sophisticated than the protagonists, which leads to his downfall.</p><h2>HOLIDAY SETTING</h2><p>As mentioned before, Die Hard takes place on Christmas Eve in Los Angeles and the characters make several nods at the holiday throughout the film.</p><p>Officer Al Powell can be heard singing Let It Snow in one scene before the corpse of one of Gruber’s men falls several stories onto his police cruiser.</p><p>Gruber mentions the holiday to another character, saying, “It’s Christmas, Theo, it’s a time for miracles.”</p><p>McClane’s limo driver, Argyle, even makes a comment about looking forward to the new year with his final line: “If this is your idea of Christmas, I gotta be here for <a href=#>New Year’s</a>.</p><p>Gruber finds one of his henchmen, Tony Vreski dead in the middle of the film, wearing a Santa hat and a jumper reading: “Now I have a machine gun. Ho-ho-ho.”</p><p>The morbid scene comes after McClane came out on top after a long, brutal fight with Vreski and wanted to send Gruber a chilling message.&nbsp;</p><h2>MUSICAL SCORE</h2><p>Die Hard also has some <a href=#>Christmas-theme music</a> on its soundtrack.</p><p>Hits such as Christmas in Hollis by Run DMC and <a href=#>Frank Sinatra’s</a> version of Let It Snow are present.</p><p>Ode to Joy by Ludwig van Beethoven, which has become a popular holiday song, is also found in the film’s score.</p><h2>SPIRIT OF FRIENDSHIP</h2><p>McClane isn’t alone during his bloody journey and has a small band of friends that help him make it through the holidays.</p><p>Most notable are his trusted driver Argyle and Sgt Al Powell, played by Reginald VelJohnson who is also known for paying Carl Winslow in the sitcom <a href=#>Family Matters</a>.</p><p>Powell and McClane are often touted as a great representation of male friendship, similar to Ellis Boyd Redding and Andy Dufresne in The Shawshank Redemption.</p><p>Fans have grown to love the two’s bond, despite the fact they only spend a few minutes onscreen together.</p><h2>BEHIND THE SCENES</h2><p>For the film’s 30th anniversary in 1988, its distributor 20th Century Fox released <a href=# aria-label="a re-edited Die Hard Trailer (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">a re-edited Die Hard Trailer</a> dubbing it as “the greatest Christmas story ever told.”</p><p>The film was portrayed as a traditional Christmas film with holiday music and new narration.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the people who played a role in the film’s creation firmly believe that Die hard is a Christmas movie, including Steven E de Souza, the film’s screenwriter.</p><p>According to de Souza, Joel Silver had predicted that Die Hard would get played at Christmastime for years to come.</p><h2>BRUCE WEIGHS IN</h2><p>Despite all these reasons, not everyone is willing to agree that Die Hard is a Christmas classic.</p><p>Bonnie Bedelia, who played McClane’s wife, Holly Gennaro-McClane, and VelJohnson both admitted that they never saw Die Hard as a Christmas movie during production.&nbsp;</p><p>“The main theme was not Christmas, it was getting McClane out of a bad situation,” VelJohnson told <a href=# aria-label="Entertainment Weekly (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>.</p><p>Bedelia chimed in: “In the script, it was not, and while we were shooting, it was not.”</p><p>However, both agreed that they enjoy the debate.</p><p>“You never know what the public is going to respond to,” said VelJohnson.&nbsp;</p><p>“Whatever in the movie makes the audience respond it, I'm all for it. Although I didn't consider it a Christmas movie before, now you couldn't tell me it isn't. I'm 100 percent certain that it is.”</p><p>Bedelia said: “It's quite wonderful that this is still being debated 30 years on.</p><p>“But, the people have spoken, and it's their movie now.</p><p>But Bruce Willis, John McClane himself, made a hard stance against the movie being called a Christmas film during his <a href=# aria-label="2018 Comedy Central Roast (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">2018 Comedy Central Roast</a>.</p><p>“I did this roast for one reason and one reason only - to settle something once and for all,” Willis said when it was his turn at the podium.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>“Now, please, listen very carefully. Die Hard is not a Christmas movie!” Willis declared to the crowd.</p><p>“It’s a g*****n Bruce Willis movie!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/sah30204-allstar-collection-20-century-208838474.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/14074-warning-photograph-editorial-use-580388034.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huaWuEen2PaJuinV2drrOwjJyfq6Gjqbqiv4ympq%2BhlWKxpq7ArZxmr5mju6a%2BjJuprpuVYsSquMuiqmg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdie-hard-christmas-movie-debate-winner-bruce-willis.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdie-hard-christmas-movie-debate-winner-bruce-willis.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdie-hard-christmas-movie-debate-winner-bruce-willis.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdie-hard-christmas-movie-debate-winner-bruce-willis.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdie-hard-christmas-movie-debate-winner-bruce-willis.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdie-hard-christmas-movie-debate-winner-bruce-willis.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tana-mongeau-sued-david-dobrik-house-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tana-mongeau-sued-david-dobrik-house-html.html>Tana Mongeau Moving Out of David Dobriks House Made Him Devalue the Place</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lola-consuelos-college-move-in-day-outfit.html>See Lola Consuelos' Trendy College Move-In Day Outfit</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lola-consuelos-college-move-in-day-outfit.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
