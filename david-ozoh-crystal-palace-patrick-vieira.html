It’s a dream come true. I can’t believe it – it’s honestly the best feeling ever.</p><p>"When I got told to warm-up I was nervous, but when I got on, I felt good and obviously just tried to play it simple, make a few passes and grow into the game.</p><p>"Honestly, coming on in this game was crazy. It was a game that we really wanted to win, and to be put on in this type of game shows how much trust the manager has in me, so I’m really pleased."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="read more in football">read more in football</h2><h2>Born in Spain</h2><p>It was a journey that began in Spain, rather than South London.</p><p>Ozoh was <a href=#>born to Nigerian parents</a> in Valencia, where he was raised until he was eight until moving to Croydon.</p><p>"My parents decided to go there for better opportunities at the time, but I moved to the UK when I was eight-years-old," he said.</p><p>"I came to Croydon; it was the first place I moved to, and I remember it like it was yesterday.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p>"Valencia is really different to Croydon! It’s hot, it’s really good. I enjoyed my time there, so I was quite sad when I [initially] moved here, but it was for the better. We came here for a better opportunity.</p><p>"I was speaking fluent Spanish, but no one believes me anymore! I forgot a bit of my Spanish - when people ask me to say things, I can't really - but I’m trying to pick it back up."</p><h2>Palace journey</h2><p>Ozoh showed an aptitude for football from a young age, and was offered places in the academies of a number of clubs in his native Spain.</p><p>However, with his parents moving to the UK, he was forced to turn them down.</p><p>Instead, he joined <a href=#>Palace's academy</a> not long after arriving on our shores.</p><p>But it wasn't until U15 level where he found his best position.</p><p>“[In the early days] I played literally everywhere. I played as striker, winger, centre-back... but in the Under-15s season I played central midfield and I felt like it just clicked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/david-ozoh-790859177.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/f5333135-6811-43f6-877f-02c1c573bcc3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/caleb-roberts-plymouth-argyle-battles-790879381.jpg><p>"It was brilliant for me, and ever since then, I’ve never looked back. I’ve always been strong on the ball, being fast, playing quick. I’ve been developing the skills I already have and making them better to progress into the first-team.</p><p>“I’ve always been bigger than my age group. That’s why they’ve tried to play me up a few times: to test me, and see that it’s not just about my strength, it’s also about my technical ability. I think I’ve done well when they’ve brought me up."</p><h2>Learning from the best</h2><p>Before he ran on to the pitch at <a href=#>Selhurst Park</a> last Saturday night, Ozoh received a pat on the back from manager Patrick Vieira.</p><p>A midfield enforcer in his day, the youngster is learning the ropes from the <a href=#>Arsenal</a> legend about his key position.</p><p>“<a href=#>Patrick Vieira</a> is a good manager. I just try and learn so much from him, as we played in the same position," Ozoh explained.</p><p>"He’s good to me, he speaks to me after training to let me know what I can do better, and I really like working with him."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/833ebb71-edd5-4377-bfdb-81a3419fce8b.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2023-crystal-palace-manager-patrick-790176272.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/d941dbaa-8a8f-4e6f-ac0c-56325a131196.jpg><p>Ozoh has been an ever-present in the U21's this season - featuring in 14 of the 15 games he was eligible to play for since signing his first professional contract back in August.</p><p>It won't be long before he's ever-present in the first team, given his rapid rise in the game.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9yfZNybWttX5mut7XDZqazp5hisLPF0q2YpWWglrmir8Rmp5qsop6wrHnVopyiqpFk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdavid-ozoh-crystal-palace-patrick-vieira.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdavid-ozoh-crystal-palace-patrick-vieira.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdavid-ozoh-crystal-palace-patrick-vieira.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdavid-ozoh-crystal-palace-patrick-vieira.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdavid-ozoh-crystal-palace-patrick-vieira.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-ozoh-crystal-palace-patrick-vieira.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jennifer-lopez-pays-tribute-to-ray-liotta.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jennifer-lopez-pays-tribute-to-ray-liotta.html>Jennifer Lopez Pays Tribute to Late Shades of Blue Costar Ray Liotta</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./brad-mehldau-19700823-html.html>Brad Mehldau (Pianist) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./brad-mehldau-19700823-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
