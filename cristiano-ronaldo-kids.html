The Manchester United striker captioned his Instagram post in Arabic, writing, "Thanks, Dubai, for the good times. Thanks, Dubai, for the warm feelings. Thank you, Dubai, for providing the best family moments. Dubai, my second home. And my family is grateful for the warm reception and generosity of your beautiful people. With all my love for you."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Georgina, who was featured in the Netflix series I Am Georgina, announced her pregnancy in a joint post with Cristiano in late October of 2021. "Delighted to announce we are expecting twins," the couple wrote. "Our hearts are full of love â€” we can't wait to meet you."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Tragically, Cristiano and Georgina suffered the loss of one of the twins later in 2022. On April 18, they announced on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> that their baby boy had died. "It is the greatest pain that any parents can feel," they wrote. "Only the birth of our baby girls gives us the strength to live this moment with some hope and happiness. [...] Our baby boy, you are our angel. We will always love you."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Meet Cristiano Ronaldo's kids.</h2><p>The couple's new baby daughter (whose name has not yet been shared) has four older siblings: 11-year-old Cristiano Jr., 4-year-old Alana Martina, and 4-year-old twins Eva Maria and Mateo. Cristiano Ronaldo shares all three 4-year-olds with Georgina; Eva Maria and Mateo were born via surrogate. The couple, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who met at the Madrid Gucci store</a> where Georgina formerly worked as a sales assistant, have been together since 2016.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The identity of Cristiano Jr.'s mother is somewhat of a mystery, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">some outlets</a> claiming she was an "American waitress" and "one-night stand." According to the Hindustan Times, Cristiano has said he wouldn't reveal his mother's identity to his son until Cristiano Jr.'s 18th birthday.</p><p>In 2011, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bleacher Report</a> published a story stating that Cristiano Jr.'s mother was a British student who had been paid over $13 million in order to give up her rights as a parent. Other outlets report that Cristiano Jr. was raised in large part by Cristiano's mother, Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro, who brought her grandson up as her own child. "Cristiano's sister, Katia Aveiro, stated Cristiano Jr. has no mother and therefore there was no woman calling him; no telephone calls or anything like that, she was dead," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">El Futbolero.</a></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>After his Instagram post of the family trip to Dubai, Cristiano shared a photo of soccer practice with his eldest son. "Present and future," he wrote under the picture of the two of them, where Cristiano is pictured shirtless in the background and Cristiano Jr. is seen wearing a Manchester United training top.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Following his father's return to Manchester United after 12 years away, Cristiano Jr. joined the club's academy, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>. "Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, claimed that her grandson was 'better than his father was at his age,'" writes the outlet, adding that the proud grandmother "expressed her desire for the 11-year-old to play for Sporting Lisbon" in the future, the same club where her own son got his start.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Georgina Rodriguez has become a household name.</h2><p>Following her stint working at the Gucci store, Georgina shifted paths into modeling and the mother is now also a social media influencer. In fact, according to her Instagram bio, the 28-year-old I Am Georgina star is also an author.</p><p>She might be adding "wife" to her lengthy resume soon. "It could be in a year, or it could be in six months or in a month," Cristiano said in Georgina's docuseries, regarding the two walking down the aisle. "I'm 1000 percent sure it will happen."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmL%2Bqv9OimKenXae8r63LnaZmo5mZwA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcristiano-ronaldo-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcristiano-ronaldo-kids.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcristiano-ronaldo-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcristiano-ronaldo-kids.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcristiano-ronaldo-kids.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcristiano-ronaldo-kids.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./avril-lavigne-young-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./avril-lavigne-young-photos.html>Avril Lavigne Through The Years: Photos Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sukshinder-shinda.html>Sukshinder Shinda</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sukshinder-shinda.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
