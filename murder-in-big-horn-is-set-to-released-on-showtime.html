<time>13 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Murder in Big Horn</strong> will debut on Showtime on Sunday, February 5, 2023, at 10 p.m. ET. The subject of the upcoming docuseries will revolve around the disappearance of indigenous women in Big Horn County, Montana. Murder in Big Horn, directed by Razelle Benally and Matthew Galkin, will include interviews and perspectives from Montana’s indigenous inhabitants and higher authorities.</p><p>According to the show’s official summary, which can be seen on YouTube,</p><p>“Murder in Big Horn paints a vivid portrayal of tribe people and their communities in Big Horn County, Montana, as they battle an epidemic of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MMIW) that has persisted since colonialism.”</p><p>It goes on to say:</p><p>“The three-part docuseries, directed by Razelle Benally and Matthew Galkin, analyze the circumstances behind many of these instances, portrayed entirely from the viewpoints of people involved: Native families, Native journalists, and local law enforcement personnel.”</p><p></p><h2>Trailer and synopsis for Murder in Big Horn</h2><p>Showtime has produced several mind-boggling documentaries over the years, including You’re Watching Video Music Box, The Fourth Estate, Amy, Shangri-La, Gossip, and others. Fans are now eagerly awaiting the release of the all-new title, Murder in Big Horn.&nbsp;The docuseries will take viewers back to a period when Big Horn County, Montana, was renowned as the “most hazardous location in the nation” for Native American women. It will highlight people who banded together to fight for justice and draw attention to the issue.</p><p>The following is how Showtime describes the show:</p><p>“When three bodies are discovered in Big Horn County, Montana, an area known as ‘the most dangerous place in the country’ for Native American women, local authorities first ignore each death before ruling them accidental, leaving the victims’ loved ones to deal with their loss as well as the law enforcement’s indifference.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Murder-in-Big-Horn-2.jpg alt="Murder in Big Horn" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>It goes on to say:</p><p>“As sadness turns to indignation, however, a strong and brave movement is developed to hunt for the truth and raise attention to the pandemic of missing or murdered cases among Native peoples in the US.”.</p><h2>Razelle Benally, the director of Murder in Big Horn, says she has always dreaded being killed.</h2><p>Benally (director-producer), Matthew Galkin (director-EP), Luella Brien (Four Points Press journalist), and Lucy Simpson (executive director, National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center) were panelists at the Sundance Film Festival’s Deadline Studio. Razelle Benally, a Native American, spoke about her experiences working on Murder in Big Horn.</p><p>She stated:</p><p>“When I was originally asked to join the project, I was concerned since there is a problem with extractive narrative in the media. So [I decided to participate] after speaking with Matthew and hearing him explain that this would be a collaborative effort.”</p><p>She proceeded to talk about her continual worry of being killed on a daily basis, saying:</p><p>“Because I had always felt so deeply about this subject, as a Native girl growing into a Native woman, the dread of being taken, missing, or killed was always a reality for me. And I’ve always incorporated a social justice component in my work. So, becoming a part of directing this documentary series was just an extension of what I was already doing as a director and filmmaker.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Murder-in-Big-Horn-1.jpg alt="Murder in Big Horn" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Lucy Simpson also commented on the title, saying:</p><p>“I believe it is about developing connections, which is why the families included in this docuseries were able and eager to convey their stories. That is who we are as Native Americans in our communities. We are related. We treat each other as if we were family.”</p><p>She went on to say:</p><p>“Building connections is essential, so having individuals come in for 18 months and committing their life to telling this narrative is more than simply telling a story. That is connection building with this community, which is uncommon in Indian Country.”</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Murder in Big Horn</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Showtime</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikrqqUmr9utc1mmaKfXZ28s7qMoqpmq5WperW7jKucpZ2RqLKlec6nZKygn6zBqrnEaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmurder-in-big-horn-is-set-to-released-on-showtime.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmurder-in-big-horn-is-set-to-released-on-showtime.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmurder-in-big-horn-is-set-to-released-on-showtime.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmurder-in-big-horn-is-set-to-released-on-showtime.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmurder-in-big-horn-is-set-to-released-on-showtime.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmurder-in-big-horn-is-set-to-released-on-showtime.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./rihanna-rocks-edgy-layers-of-pearls-for-la-outing-8414623.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./rihanna-rocks-edgy-layers-of-pearls-for-la-outing-8414623.html>Rihanna Rocks Edgy Layers of Pearls on L.A.
