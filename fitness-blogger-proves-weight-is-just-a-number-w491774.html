The British mom, who embarked on a fitness journey in May 2015, went viral two years later when she posted a dramatic side-by-side transformation photo and revealed that she still weighs the same: 138 pounds.</p><p>Now Rees, 36, is back in the news after sharing her diet “secret” with her 251,000 followers.</p><p>“I still eat cake more days than not . . . I still drink Prosecco, I still can’t seem to resist stealing snacks from the kids’ junk food cupboard,” Rees wrote on June 27. In the accompanying side-by-side images, she is seen at age 34 and at age 36. Her weight is 138 pounds in both, but at 36 she has six-pack abs and her muscles are noticeably more defined.</p><p>Rees went on to explain that two years ago, gorging on foods such as pizza and fries would send her into a downward spiral and fuel her excuses to quit exercising. “Now these same foods (and my passion for them) fuel my ambition to condition my body,” she continued. “If a day happens where I binge eat cake and a tub of water . . . I leave it at just that . . . a day that happened. It doesn’t derail my goals like it used to. I don’t see it as a reason to give up.”</p><p>The mom of Charlie, 12, and Maddie, 2, signed off with an inspirational message: “On those days when it all goes horribly wrong . . . as it inevitably will . . . just remove your face from the tub of butter . . . replace the lid and continue on exactly as you were . . . motivated, goal oriented and #healthyAF.”</p><p><a href=#>My body has changed about a million times in the last 2 years and it’s going to change a million times more as I get older. . . Some of the changes I can control, some of the changes I will no doubt, work for, to make them happen… but for the most part the changes will happen just because life happens. . . The best thing I have learned over the last two years is that the shape of your body does not determine your happiness but it can overshadow it if you let it. . . 2 years ago I confused being frustrated with my body and my choices as me being ‘unhappy’. Looking back I wasn’t unhappy at all, I had just had a miracle baby… I was probably the happiest I had ever been.. but Just like the euphoria of a new baby can sometimes be over shadowed by lack of sleep, lack of hot showers and constant breastfeeding, morning, noon and night. Sometimes having a negative relationship with your body or your lifestyle choices prohibits you from actually fully feeling the happiness that is all around you… . . The best thing I learned, was not a fitness tip or a diet hack …it was to never see my body and my happiness as part of the same equation. . Once you have that the rest is just apple pie. . . I’m not on an endless quest for abs and eternal youth (even though I’m sure it sometimes seems like it) I want to grow older, without pressure, accepting whatever my body looks like at any given time .. knowing I did my best to love it and live it in all at the same time. . . Your body will change everyday for the rest of your life, so there’s absolutely no point attaching any part of your happiness to it. . . Never let how you see your body stop you from feeling how happy your heart is ☺️ . . . #soppy #anniversarypost #tbt #throwbackthursday #bbg #kaylaitsines #beforeandafter #bbgprogress #bbgtransformation #fitmum #bbgmums #happy #fitspo #bopo #bodyimage</a></p><p>A post shared by Nikki Rees (@activelyrees) on May 4, 2017 at 12:00pm PDT</p><p>The 5-foot-7 Rees began Kayla Itsines’ Bikini Body Guides program shortly after giving birth to her daughter.</p><p>“Four months after the baby arrived, I visited my sister in London for her birthday. We had planned a big night out to celebrate and I remember convincing myself that if I could squeeze my postpartum body into a tight dress. I would be able to feel good about myself,” Rees tells <i>Us Weekly </i>exclusively. “I did everything I thought would help. I got a spray tan, I painted my nails, I blew out my hair and armed myself with a pair of super-strength control Spanx.”</p><p>Only the evening didn’t go according to plan. “My tummy forced its way over the top of my Spanx, which had rolled down, and I was literally bulging through the midsection of my too-tight dress,” Rees tells Us. “I felt so terrible about myself that I refused to take off my coat and sat through the whole dinner with my arms wrapped tightly over my stomach.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><span class=caption></span><p>That night, Rees decided she would change her life. “I posted my first fitness Instagram the very next day,” she says. “And I’ve been posting every day since.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGafoaSjsrS%2FjJujqJ%2BXmr9uvNGorZ6rXayyqrPHrWSiq12fwrTAjJpkp62dl7KzedZtcGpvZ2l8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffitness-blogger-proves-weight-is-just-a-number-w491774.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffitness-blogger-proves-weight-is-just-a-number-w491774.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffitness-blogger-proves-weight-is-just-a-number-w491774.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffitness-blogger-proves-weight-is-just-a-number-w491774.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffitness-blogger-proves-weight-is-just-a-number-w491774.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffitness-blogger-proves-weight-is-just-a-number-w491774.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./key-glocks-girlfriend-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./key-glocks-girlfriend-list.html>Key Glocks Girlfriend: Who is Key Glock Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-jon-lee-brody-dating.html>Who is Jon Lee Brody Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-jon-lee-brody-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
