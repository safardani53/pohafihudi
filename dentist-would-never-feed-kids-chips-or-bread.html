Microorganisms naturally found in your mouth convert sugars into acid and this causes tooth decay.”</p><p>The expert, who has been a dentist for more than 18 years, holds a special interest in antimicrobial treatment, fresh breath and whitening whilst encouraging her patients to maintain and look after their own natural teeth.&nbsp;</p><p>These are the top foods she would not give to kids...</p><h2><strong>FRUIT DRINKS AND SPORTS DRINKS</strong></h2><p>Dr Shoaei said she would never give fruit drinks or sports drinks to kids as these are very acidic and sugary - meaning they can cause tooth decay.</p><p>She said: “I wouldn’t replace sugar free drinks with the normal versions either.&nbsp;</p><p>“These are not good because the sugar is replaced with artificial sugar which is also acidic regardless of whether it is sugar free or not.”</p><h2><strong>CHIPS</strong></h2><p>The expert dentist said she’d also steer clear of giving kids chips, otherwise known as French fries.</p><p>Simply because these don’t hold any nutritional value.</p><p>She said: “Additionally, the starch in them harms the teeth. In the mouth, it breaks down into simple sugars. It gets stuck between the teeth and can cause tooth decay.”&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>DRIED FRUIT</strong></h2><p>Dr Mahsa Shoaei also would not give children dried fruit as the dried fruit is a lot like sticky, chewy candy.&nbsp;</p><p>The fruit snacks and dried fruit can get stuck to the child’s enamel and become a feeding ground for bacteria.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>LOTS OF CITRUS FRUIT</strong></h2><p>As much as fruit is good for kids, it should only be enjoyed in moderation - says Dr Shoaei.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The dentist said: “Citrus fruits are very acidic but if you rinse with water and brush your teeth after consuming, it can lower the risk of cavity.”</p><h2><strong>TOO MUCH BREAD</strong></h2><p>Another one to make sure you don’t give kids excessively is bread.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr Shoaei said: “Bread is also high in starch and converted into a simple sugar that can cause tooth decay.&nbsp;</p><p>“If your child has optimal oral hygiene and you are helping them with brushing and keeping their teeth cleaned, bread can be consumed in moderation without causing any tooth decay.”</p><h2><strong>GUMMY LUNCH-BAG SNACKS</strong></h2><p>The expert dentist said she would never give children gummy lunch-bag snacks.</p><p>These jelly-like snacks are loaded with sugar and are prone to sticking to teeth, especially the molars where it’s hard to clean.&nbsp;</p><p>She added: “Plus, the sour ones are extra unhealthy due to a combination of acidity, stickiness and sugar!”</p><h2><strong>GUMMY MULTIVITAMINS</strong></h2><p>Another one that the dentist would avoid - that may surprise a lot of parents - are gummy multivitamins.&nbsp;</p><p>She explained: “Gummy multivitamins are usually made with glucose syrup or sucrose which are basically sugars.&nbsp;</p><p>“Try to look for sugar free versions instead.”</p><h2><strong>PRETZELS</strong></h2><p>Lastly, the dentist said she would never give kids pretzels to snack on.&nbsp;</p><p>She said: “These salty snacks leave a sticky carbohydrate on the teeth that also sticks to the enamel all day and can cause cavities.”</p><p>Instead, Dr Shoaei provided her tips for what kids should eat - that will encourage their healthy teeth.&nbsp;</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">DR SHOAEI TIPS FOR WHAT KIDS SHOULD EAT:</h3></p><ul id=block-10ece421-8e52-4884-a5f9-5dc78438664b><li>Your child should eat more nuts as they are high in phosphorus and calcium</li><li>Apples are full in fibre and great in scrubbing the plaque away</li><li>Carrots and celery because the fibre and water found in these vegetables help to balance the mouth’s PH</li><li>Green leafy vegetables are foods full of folic acids and can improve the health of teeth and gums</li><li>Eggs have plenty of protein, calcium and VitaminD. These minerals are essential for oral health.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>However, it’s not just about choosing good food for your children.&nbsp;</p><p>She said: “In addition to choosing good food for teeth, your children should practice brushing their teeth twice a day for three minutes.</p><p>“Plus, up to the age of 10, an adult should help them to reach their back teeth.&nbsp;</p><p>“Most cavities can be seen in the molars mainly because they have deep fissures and food gets stuck inside them and because children can not reach all the way back to keep them clean.&nbsp;</p><p>“We also start to introduce floss when all adult teeth have erupted, usually around age 13. This will help them to keep clean between their teeth where the majority of decay happens”&nbsp;</p><p>Dr Shoaei also recommended children see their dentist and hygienist every six months so they can support them in their oral health and give them information about their diet.&nbsp;</p><p>The expert explained the key is to ensure children have fun when they visit their dentist or hygienist and that it’s an informative session with basic language so they can understand.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr Shoaei added: “I also leave some time to answer their questions because I find they are all very interested in knowing more about their teeth.&nbsp;</p><p>“Building a good relationship is key so kids can look forward to their next visit!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000680453557-1.jpg><p>Elsewhere in parenting, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">expert reveals the two types of child & the right way to discipline each one</a> (and what happens when you get it wrong).</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Meanwhile, I’ve slept with over 16k people – <a href=#>my fiancé still loves me and we can’t wait to get married.</a></p><p>And dentist reveals <a href=#>why it’s dangerous to brush your teeth right after breakfast.</a></p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Doctor’s viral hacks to quit smoking and beat nicotine cravings for good</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5BvaWloZW2BcLDEp6uiq6RixLDBy51kp52mmr9ussSem2ajmZnAbq%2FHoqesZZ%2BneqO%2BxJqbaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdentist-would-never-feed-kids-chips-or-bread.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdentist-would-never-feed-kids-chips-or-bread.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdentist-would-never-feed-kids-chips-or-bread.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdentist-would-never-feed-kids-chips-or-bread.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdentist-would-never-feed-kids-chips-or-bread.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdentist-would-never-feed-kids-chips-or-bread.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./james-bettcher.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./james-bettcher.html>James Bettcher- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Ethnicity</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./gisele-bundchen-sizzles-in-tiny-string-bikini-at-the-beach-in-brazil.html>Gisele Bundchen Sizzles in Tiny String Bikini at the Beach in Brazil Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./gisele-bundchen-sizzles-in-tiny-string-bikini-at-the-beach-in-brazil.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
