Eventually, the success from these programs brought Mel to Get Smart, a show he co-created with <strong>Buck Henry</strong> that parodied James Bond-esque spy-thrillers.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>After turning to the big screen with The Producers, Mel followed up with Blazing Saddles, which poked&nbsp;at the western genre, and Young Frankenstein, a spoof of the story of popular horror franchise,&nbsp;Frankenstein. He would continue his film career into his old age, eventually directing and starring in Space Balls,&nbsp;Robin Hood: Men in Tights, and&nbsp;his last directorial credit,&nbsp;Dracula: Dead and Loving It. Regarded as one of the greatest comedic writers&nbsp;of all time, he was awarded&nbsp;the highest honors from the American Film Institute: the&nbsp;AFI Life Achievement Award in 2013.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Mel was just as successful in his personal life as well. He had three children with his first wife <strong>Florence Baum</strong>: <strong>Stephanie, Nicky, </strong>and <strong>Eddie.</strong> Not much is known about their marriage and they divorced in 1962. Two years later, Mel would meet the love of his life on the set of The Perry Como Variety Show. <strong>Anne Bancroft,</strong> also known as the seductress Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate, would eventually marry Mel in 1964.

Very smart, brilliant.”</p><h2>Nicky</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Nicholas “Nicky” Brooks was born on Dec. 13, 1957, in N.Y.C.

He waded in the Hollywood child actor pool for a hot second, as his two cinematic roles of note were as Sheldon Hocheiser in “Where’s Poppa?” in 1970 and the New Son in “Armchair Theatre” in 1961, per his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDB</a>.

His biggest success, however, came as a New York Times best selling author, which hit a high note with his post-apocalyptic novel,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> World War Z</a>, which became a vehicle for <strong>Brad Pitt</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Although Max does not appear to have a social media account, he did go viral in 2020 when making a Covid safety video with his dad Mel. &nbsp;“Hi, I’m Max Brooks, I’m 47 years old. This is my dad, Mel Brooks, he’s 93,” Max said, standing outside as Brooks stood behind a glass door. “If I get the coronavirus, I’ll probably be okay. But if I give it to him, he could give it to <strong>Carl Reiner</strong>, who could give it to&nbsp;<strong>Dick Van Dyke</strong>, and before I know it, I’ve wiped out a whole generation of comedic legends. When it comes to coronavirus, I have to think about who I can infect. And so should you.” Watch above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8yeo2aaoqS8rL%2BMpKCdq11qfnSDkGxvaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmel-brooks-kids-5137138.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmel-brooks-kids-5137138.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmel-brooks-kids-5137138.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmel-brooks-kids-5137138.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmel-brooks-kids-5137138.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmel-brooks-kids-5137138.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mom-makes-tooth-fairy-masks-coronavirus-pandemic.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mom-makes-tooth-fairy-masks-coronavirus-pandemic.html>Mom Makes Coronavirus Masks for Tooth Fairy at Daughter's Request</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./julia-roberts-through-the-years-photos-pics.html>Julia Roberts Through The Years: Photos Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./julia-roberts-through-the-years-photos-pics.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
