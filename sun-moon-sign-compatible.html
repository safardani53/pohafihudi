they would rather keep everyone at an arm's length, which makes them a mystery to the people around them.</p><p><b>Get all the latest </b><a href=#><b>Aquarius horoscope news</b></a><b> including your weekly and monthly predictions</b></p><h3>Pisces</h3><p><a href=#>Pisces</a> moons are gentle, sympathetic and extremely emotionally vulnerable.</p><p>They are an open book and can't help but spill their feelings to everyone who would listen.</p><p>Caring and kind, they tend to display a giving side in their relationships, putting their partner's emotions and needs above their own.</p><p>If you have this placement, you need to learn to protect yourself from people who might be taking advantage of your selfless nature.</p><p><b>Get all the latest </b><a href=#><b>Pisces horoscope news</b></a><b> including your weekly and monthly predictions</b></p><h2>What star signs are most compatible?</h2><p>It can be difficult to find true<a href=#> love</a>, but the stars can help you.</p><p>Your Moon sign can <a href=#>help guide your love life</a>.</p><p>Because Moon signs are in charge of our emotions, they can make an impact on our love lives.</p><p>Two people with the same Sun sign and different Moon signs might have a totally different approach to love.</p><p>Have a look at this grid from <a href=# rel=noopener>Cafe Astrology</a> to see if your sign matches up with your other half -
