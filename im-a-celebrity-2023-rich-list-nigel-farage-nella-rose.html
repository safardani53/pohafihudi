£4.8m</h2><p>Unsurprisingly, Jamie Lynn Spears is the richest person in this year’s <a href=#>I’m A Celeb lineup</a>, with an estimated £4.8million fortune.</p><p>However, that’s nothing compared to older sister <a href=#>Britney Spears</a>’ £48million.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="MORE TV FEATURES">MORE TV FEATURES</h2><p>Jamie Lynn made her acting debut in Britney’s 2002 film Crossroads, age 11.</p><p>She went on to star as the title character in Nickelodeon show <a href=#>Zoey 101</a> from 2005 to 2008, until she became pregnant with her first child, Maddie.</p><p>In January 2022, four months after the end of <a href=#>Britney’s conservatorship</a>, which Jamie Lynn claims to have had little part in, she released a memoir titled Things I Should Have Said, which would have added to her fortune.</p><p>This year, she has also taken part in the USA’s versions of <a href=#>Celebrity SAS</a> and <a href=#>Strictly</a> -
